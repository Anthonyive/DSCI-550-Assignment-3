       " {'content': 'URGENT ASSISTANCE /RELATIONSHIP (P)Dear Friend,I am Mr. Ben Suleman a custom officer and work as Assistant controller of the Customs and Excise department Of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs stationed at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos-Nigeria.After the sudden death of the former Head of state of Nigeria General Sanni Abacha on June 8th 1998 his aides and immediate members of his family were arrested while trying to escape from Nigeria in a Chartered jet to Saudi Arabia with 6 trunk boxes Marked \"Diplomatic Baggage\". Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00(One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars).I declared only (5) five boxes to the government and withheld one (1) in my custody containing the sum of (US$30,000,000.00) Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amountingto US$55 Billion Dollars (ref:ngrguardiannews.com) of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one (1)box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as \"Precious Stones and Jewellry\" in other that itscontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we (myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team) are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. However as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our accountcannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.Therefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria tomove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries\" which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. This business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.Expecting your response urgently.Best regards,Mr. Ben Suleman',\n",

       " {'content': 'I Need Your Assistance.Dear sir,  It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest (heart attack) while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit; the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband\\'s properties is under the authority of the family\\'s lawyer Tony Musa.  My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husband\\'s wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the \"Personal will\" of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f!urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used; as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this \"SOS\" call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email: tony_m@lawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him (my Attorney) on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha  ',\n",

I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.Best Regards, Mr.Michael Kamah and family. \",\n",

First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me.I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.This amount (US$18.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the US$18.5 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hind!rance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above tel/fax number ,or my email address:mboro@accountant.com whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me contact other another Foreign partner with recommendation to carry out this deal. I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter; because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business. I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. I am available to entertain any questions concerning the clarity of this transaction. Yours faithfully,Mr  George  Mboro',\n",

I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction which is of mutual benefit. I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporatio(NNPC). Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in NNPC by my Committee. This contract was over invoiced to the tune of US$21.5M. U.S. Dollars. This was done deliberately. The over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project. We now want to transfer this money which is in a suspense Account with NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you to provide for us. SHARE: - For providing the account where we shall remit the money into, you will be entitled to 30% of the money,60% will be for me andmy partners while 10% has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that maybe incurred by us during the course of this transfer,both locally and international expenses.

The above information would be used to make formal applications as a matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to your account. It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of this nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies. More often than not,big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized firms for execution of such contracts. We have strong reliable connections and contacts at the Central Bank of Nigeria, as well as the Federal Ministry of Finance and we have no doubt that all the money will be released and transferred if we get the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. Therefore,when the business is successfully concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned Government Ministries for 100% security. We are ordinary civil servants and we will not want to miss this once in a lifetime opportunity to get rich. We want this money to be transferred to the overseas Accounts for us, before the present Democratic Government start Auditing all Federal Government owned Parastatals.

From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,          Johannesburg,South Africa.My Dear ,Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an!d confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugab!e's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;1.

My name is Mr.David Agu an auditor at one of the Federal Ministries in lagos-Nigeria. During our last audit exercise,some amount of money totalling $16.5Million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Muller Robert, a foreigner who died in a plane crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted my curiosity. I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the ministry that he executed the contract for. A panel setup by the Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail.It is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Usman Bello, that arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad. I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for investment purposes in your country.

       " {'content': \"PARTNERSHIPSubject: BUSINESS PROPOSALImportance: HIGHGood day, This might seem very deplorable for a person that you do not know. My name is Clement Apute,I am a lawyer and a very close confidant to my client who also happens to be my sister-in-law. I am contacting you because of the my client's urgent need to go into partnership with someone,who is not from this country, as a result of their family's present situation in the country,and specifically because you have a fixed address or let me say fixed responsibilities, which can stands as a good reason to go into partnership with you. The present situation right now, requires good understanding and a good sense of judgment.My sister-in-law and her entire family are really suffering from the hands of some wicked people who are drunk with power.This is just a personal vendetta by the head of states, because he was jailed by my client husband's regime in 1997, for actually plotting a coup d 'etat against their military administration then, when they were in power. It is very clear that our present head of states wants to take advantage of his seat in power to settle his personal hatred for my client's family.This man is bent on destroying my client's family. The family has virtually lost all their family's money and properties due to this vindictive administration in power now. who are bent on dealing with the family.All their bank accounts have been frozen,assets and their properties which I helped in managing have been confiscated and are still non functional till this present day. His administration has spread so much rumors against their family, which is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to frustrate, humiliate, dismember and widen the scope ofhatred to my client's family. Right now it is completely impossible for any member of the family to make any move because the entire family are being placed under traveling restrictions.About a few months ago we were squished out of another US$395 million dollars, and these wicked people have completely dammed the fact that all this funds can be ascertained for independently. Presently, the family is finding it very hard to manage as we have completely run out of resources, because everything has been taken away from madam and her children. My client needs sombody that she can confide in,presently the family still has some amounts of money to the sum of 84 million US dollars and some fractions in cash,which the family has spread out and lodged in the vault of different Securities outfits in two countries there in Asia and also in Europe.The existence of these monies is not in any way known to anybody else,not even all mama's children, apart from her eldest son. The money was lodged in as jewelry. This is a precaution to maintain a very high level secrecy, because this is all the family have left to fall back on. So we expect you to keep this matter in confidence.Madam wants a partner to proceed as soon as possible and retrieve some money lodged in any of this security outfits and handle it as duly instructed. The family needs somebody to help them withdraw there deposits because the family is financially down here in the country, since everything they own here have been taken away from them. We are looking for an understanding partner that can work with us. All we require from you is to help the familyto go and retrieve any one of the family's deposits that is lodged in one of these places and keep safely in your care, since none of us is able to travel out of this country due to traveling restrictions.Secondly,so that you can always withdraw little part out of their money that will be in your possession and send it down here to us here,anytime the family is in great need. In this way they can continue to sustain the family until they are free from thier enemies. As their lawyer i will be instructing, on how you will go about that. We will be providing you withall the legal documents to make claim on behalf of my client. Please be rest assured that you will have no problems or difficulties in claiming any of these deposits because nobody is aware of the existence of this money. All the details will be given to you when we open up negotiations and arrive at a reasonable compromise and until I gain your trust to see that we can work together. We will negotiate on a certain percentage share of the money that the family will offer to you for your expected assistance and partnership. Please do inform me on your decision immediately, so as to stop further contacts. I await your response. NOTE - You can also get in contact with me via my securedemail:clem-aputa@earthling.net I will like to have your private phone number so that we can discuss better. Regards, Clement Apute.

       " {'content': \"ASSISTANCEDear Sir I am mr Godwin Igbunu, the Bank Manager of Regent Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1997, a FOREIGN Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Roger Berget made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$8,000,000.00 (Eight Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Ministry of Defence headquater in Abuja that Mr. Roger Berget died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin to date has fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Roger Berget did not declare any kin or relations in! all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$8,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger Berget so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names, address, telephone and fax numers so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and not!arization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your nominated account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% to cover any accidental expenses on either sides during the course of this transaction. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via this email address. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction better. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transactio!n would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Looking forward to hearing from you soonest. Best regards, Mr Godwin Igbunu Please you can also reach me with this email address igbunu2@caramail.com and telephone number 234-80232-97216 \",\n",

       " {'content': 'Inheritance Claim(Urgent Response)ATTN:MANAGING DIRECTORI am writing this proposal hoping that you would be of assistance in this business of mutual benefit. My name is Mr.David Agu an auditor at one of the Federal Ministries in lagos-Nigeria. During our last audit exercise,some amount of money totalling $16.5Million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Muller Robert, a foreigner who died in a plane crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted my curiosity. I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the ministry that he executed the contract for. A panel setup by the Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail.It is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Usman Bello, that arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad. I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for investment purposes in your country.

Consequent upon the assassination of my husband, I am in possession of USD 58,000,000 (Fifty Eight Million US Dollars Only) being funds earlier earmarked for special projects.  This fund has since been deposited in a security company in West African Country of Togo where I am residing now with my children.It is now my intention to move the said fund out of this place (Togo) to a safer place for the benefit of my children and I, for immediate investment.  Based on this that I solicited for your assistance to enable me take this money out of Togo. However, note that my children and I have agreed togive you 20% of the total fund if you can accept the offer of assisting us.  Also it will be your responsibility in directing us on a viable business. It is also my intention to relocate and probably take a temporarily resident in your country pending when all the troubles in my country will be resolved. We advised that you look for a house we will buy as soon as we arrived. To conclude this transaction, you will be required to come to Togo to open an account in any bank here in Togo where the security company will deposit the total sum in your favor. From this bank the money will be remitted into your original bank in your country. Immediately this done, all of us will depart Togo to your country, where my children and I are expected to take a temporary resident. Please note that I can not open any Bank account with my name because, My late husband's first son-JOSEPH-who took over power in our country, don't want to see me and my children, He claimed that when our husband was alive, that I was very close to him than any other of his wives including his (Joseph) mother. He also claimed that because of my closeness to him that I was able to get things from him more than others. As a result he has been monitoring me. Infact this one of the main reasons I want to take mychildren out of our country and any nearby country.

He died with a fellow business associate in a ghastly auto crash last October and his remains have since been incarcerated. Since his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and put claims as the next of kin and beneficiary to the resources in Monsieur. Ives Laurent account, for it is against the ethics and norms of the finance institution to claim such resources without a beneficiary unless proclaimed by the government.The federal government of Nigeria has given directives to finance institutions to declare adamant accounts that has stayed more than 8months in their custody as they intend to use it to pay off her military peace keeping force (ECOMOG) who fought in War ravaged African countries precisely and as the case may be, Late Monsieur. Ives Laurent account fell into this category thus the necessity for contacting you for I am determined to move this fund out as the rigorous and rash economic decision and policies has really turned we government workers to mere civil laborers. I have worked for almost a decade and half and I have nothing to show as reaps and rewards of my hard earned labor.

My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. My Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek! political asylum.I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for security reasons, and have now deicded to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit. President Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here.I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.Your role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.To know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate Angola, click on the link below and read. http://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.htmlSincerely,O.C.Savimbi.\",\n",

       " {'content': 'Business Cooperation ( Inheritance Claim)From: Mr.Daniel OsonduFax: Number +23417597019 Dear Sir,I am writing this proposal hoping that you would be of assistance in this business of mutual benefit. My name is Daniel Osondu an auditor at one of the Banks in lagos-Nigeria. During our last audit exercise,some amount of money totalling $18.5Million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Manfred Becker, a foreigner who died in a crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted our curiosity. I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the Ministry that he executed the contract for and also with our Bank. A panel setup by the Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail.It is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Thomas Danababa , that arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad. I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for investment purposes in your country. If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly reach me immediately via my confidential fax number +23417597019 furnishing me with your most confidential telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the transaction.

But I believe it is one day that you get to know somebody either in physical or through correspondence. I got your contact through some discreet inquiry from the chamber of commerce and industry, you and your organization were revealed as being quite astute in private entrepreneurship, one has no doubt in your ability to handle a financial business transaction.

I am making this contact to you in respect of US 28,000,000.00 (Twenty eight million United States Dollars) which I inherited from my late father. This money was accumulated from royalties paid to my father as compensation by the oil firms located in our area as a result of oil presence on our land which hamper agriculture which is our major source of livelihood. Unfortunately my father died from protracted diabetes. But before his he called my attention and informed me that he lodged some funds on a two boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary status. The lodgment Security Code Number was also revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a reliable business partner abroad, who will assist me in investing the money in a lucrative business as a result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this is the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move this money from the security firm to any country of your choice for investment purposes.  So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so that the funds can be moved in your name and particulars to any country of your choice where it will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had intimated the security firm personnel that the beneficiary of the Box is his foreign partner whose particulars will be forwarded to the firm when due.  But I will guide you accordingly.

My husband was named one of the ten Outstanding Young Men in Public Administration. He was also named Most Outstanding Mayor and Foremost Nationalist and Most Outstanding Metro Manila Mayor. My husband is recently accused of illegal acquire some four Billion Peso ($80M) during his 31 months in office as President backed up by an uprising of mass Demonstrators and Senate Traitors. They also said that he has skimmed off tobacco excise Taxes benefitting from government business deals.Most of them benefitted from my husband's generousity when he was in office. But they just turned around to be the ones to impeach him. I have tried every possible means to get him out of Detention without success. The Despotic forces in power appear bent in deriding him, rubbishing his achievements while freezing all his known Bank accounts.He has been accused of economic plunder carrying the maximum penalty of death. To the worst of it all,all other wives of my husband especailly Guia Gomez and some of his children born outside wedlock are testifying against us.In conjunction with the PCGG funded by the recent President Arroyo Macapagal Gloria. These are some of the allegations file! before my husband in the impeachment trial; 1. Gov.

That my husband participated in a real estate business controlled by me and my son Jose despite a prohibition on outside business interests while in office.

I am\\rcontacting you after a frantic search for a person who will be\\rtrustworthy and capable of handling a business of this dimension.\\r\\rMy name is Mr. Jonathan Mokoena, the Under-Secretary in charge of\\rIntergration at the Specialized Technical Committee of the African\\rUnion (AU), formerly Organization of Afriacn Unity (OAU). You may be\\raware of the transformation of the OAU to AU, and the mandate to\\rbuild a new united Africa modelled on the pattern of European Union\\r(EU). For this therefore, the various African leaders recently\\rinaugurated the New Patnership for African Development (NEPAD). NEPAD\\ris to streamline Africa towards achieving a common market, defence\\rforce, currency, foreign policy, judiciary etc. For the above, the\\rvarious African countries have made whosoever contributions in\\rhundreds of million dollars. We have equally received grants/aids\\rfrom the EU, USA and other international governments and agencies.\\rThese moneies in all have ran into millions of dollars.\\r\\r\\rAs the officer in charge of receiving and managing these funds and\\rexecuting the projects for which they are ment for, I have received\\rall the money expected. I have also prepared my account which I have\\rsubmitted to the AU High Command, and it has been approved by the AU\\rSecratary-General, Dr. Amara Essy. However, in some of the money\\rreceived, some of the donor countries and international bodies\\rremitted to us amounts in excess of what they pledged. The AU before\\rnow, has written to all of them to acknowledge the receipt of the\\rmonies from them. The money in excess and which I have kept out with\\ronly me having knowledge of it, is in the tune of Thirty-Five Million United States Dollars (US$35,000,000.00). As it is now, this money belongs to me, as neither the AU nor any of the donor countries/international agencies has declared their money missing.\\r\\r\\rI am therefore contacting you to assist me with the movement and\\rsafe-keeping of this fund. As a public officer in my category, I\\rcannot openly put this money into any bank here in Addis Ababa,\\rEthiopia, the AU headquarters where I am now, or in any other part of\\rAfrica, as an account holder. This will surely raise eyebrows and\\rexpose me. I have therefore concealed this amount of US$35M in four\\rmetal trunk boxes, and declared them as artefacts belonging to a\\rforeigner. I deposited the boxes with a Security Company based in\\rSpain which has an affliate offices in Ghana, Cot d'Ivoire and South Africa. These cities are safe havens for this kind of transaction.\\r\\rThis transaction will however be hitch-free. So, I would therefore\\rwant you to be in Banjul, The Gambia for the clearing and claiming of\\rthis fund. I will furnish you with information/documents on how\\r\\ryou will stand as the beneficiary of the boxes. I have decided to\\rgive to you 40% of the total amount involved.\\r\\rPlease I will want you to contact me on this e-mail address or the\\ralternative: (joe_mokoena@fastermail.com).\\r\\r\\rAlso, you have to assure me of the secrecy and confidentiality in\\rthis transaction.\\r\\rThanks in anticipation of your valued co-operation.\\r\\rMr. Jonathan Mokoena.\\r\\r\\r\\r\",\n",

It is in view of this that I seek your co-operation and assistance in the transfer of the sum of US$100Million only being the very last of my family fund in my possession and control. The Federal Government have seized all our properties and frozen all our accounts both local and international, but my only hope now is the available US$100Million cash, which I carefully packaged and deposited with a security finance company in Holland.My purpose of contacting you is for someone who will be able to pay the dumurrage charges incured in the security finance company and also after transfering the funds, will be able to invest the funds on my behalf till such a time when I will be free from my present predicament.Your benefit I can assure you will be very substantial.

I am 35, and had worked with a bank (one of the African leading banks in the West Coast). Here in this bank existed a dormant account for the past 8 years which belong to a Syria national who is now late.  When we discovered that there had been no deposits nor withdrawals from this account for this long period, I and my two other colleagues decided to carry out a system investigation and discovered that non of the family member nor relations of the late Syrian is aware of this account.  This is the story in a nutshell.  Now we want an account overseas where we can transfer this funds. Thereafter, we had planned to destroy all related documents for this account. It is a careful network and for the past eleven months we have worked out everything to ensure a hitch-free operation.   The amount is not so much at the moment and plus all the accumulated interest the balance in this account stands at-US$9,000.000.00 million US dollars.  Now our questions are:-  1. Can you handle this project? 2. Can we give you this trust? 3. What will be your commission?  Consider this and get back at us as soon as possible.  Finally, it is our humble prayer that the information as contained herein be accorded the necessary attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves.

Consequent upon the assassination of my husband, I am in possession of USD 58,000,000 (Fifty Eight Million US Dollars Only) being funds earlier earmarked for special projects.  This fund has since been deposited in a security company in West African Country of Togo where I am residing now with my children.It is now my intention to move the said fund out of this place (Togo) to a safer place for the benefit of my children and I, for immediate investment.  Based on this that I solicited for your assistance to enable me take this money out of Togo. However, note that my children and I have agreed togive you 20% of the total fund if you can accept the offer of assisting us.  Also it will be your responsibility in directing us on a viable business. It is also my intention to relocate and probably take a temporarily resident in your country pending when all the troubles in my country will be resolved. We advised that you look for a house we will buy as soon as we arrived. To conclude this transaction, you will be required to come to Togo to open an account in any bank here in Togo where the security company will deposit the total sum in your favor. From this bank the money will be remitted into your original bank in your country. Immediately this done, all of us will depart Togo to your country, where my children and I are expected to take a temporary resident. Please note that I can not open any Bank account with my name because, My late husband's first son-JOSEPH-who took over power in our country, don't want to see me and my children, He claimed that when our husband was alive, that I was very close to him than any other of his wives including his (Joseph) mother. He also claimed that because of my closeness to him that I was able to get things from him more than others. As a result he has been monitoring me. Infact this one of the main reasons I want to take mychildren out of our country and any nearby country.

       " {'content': \"URGENT AND CONFIDENTIALKAMBILI BOB3/5 RIDES GARDENCLOSE JO'BURG,SOUTH AFRICAMY DEAR , I am Bob Kambili, Bank manager of First national bankSouth Africa Pty, South Africa,(www.fnb.co.za) and forreasons which will become obvious to you as read on, Iobtained your address particulars from an Internetaddress listing. Please exercise some patience andread through my message.  You can reach me immediatelyon my private email address  (henryfnbsa@mail.com)I have a very urgent and confidential business proposition for you. On June 6th 1998, a GoldConsultant/Contractor with the South African NationalGold Corporation, Mr. Ahmed Youseff Mustafa , anational of Iraq, made a numbered time ( fixed)deposit for 12 calendar months, value USD52,000,000.00 (FIFTY TWO MILION DOLLAS)  in mybranch. On maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally, his contract employers, the South African National Gold Corporationwrote to inform us that Mr. A Y Mustafa died from anautomobile accident; that he died without making aWILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kinthrough the Iraqi embassy were fruitless. At first Iwas surprised that I did not receive much officialcooperation in my inquiries in order to trace his kinin Iraq, and inform them about Mr. Mustafa�s depositof USD52m plus accrued interest. I therefore madefurther investigations and discovered that Mr. Mustafahad actively opposed the Government of PresidentSaddam Hussein of Iraq, and was consequently driveninto exile. Being an minning Expert,he subsequentlyobtained a job with the South Africa Gold Coporation, and settled in South Africa. Thereafter, he walkedinto my Office to make the aforementioned deposit ofUSD52m. He did not declare any kin in his applicationpaperwork, contrary to laid down procedures, and whenI asked him he informed me that he wished it so. Iaccepted his application because banks areconservative and will always honour a customer�swishes, especially high networth customers. No oneknows the source of his money because apparently thetime frame of his employment with the ASGC does indeedpreclude such a large amount of money. It can beassumed that he brought his money over from Iraq, butthat is open to speculation. However, the point isthat his employers are not aware of this money , andtherefore it can be safely assumed that no one willever come forward to claim this money. This moneytotal USD52m ( inclusive of accrued interests) isstill sitting in my Bank in the Dormant AccountPortfolio. No one will ever come forward to claim itnow, and according to South African law, after 5 years, the money will automatically revert to the Federal Government Treasury if the Account owner is a foreigner, is certified dead , and there isno valid claim. This indeed, is the situation. Myproposal therefore is that I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Mustafa. It is not necessary to be a blood relation to Mr. Mustafa, nor have the same name. It isnot also necessary to come from the same Country. Ihave worked out the modalities to achieve my aim ofappointing a next of kin, and therefore also by thismeans transfer this money total USD52m abroad for usto share. The method of achieving the objective of transferring this money abroad in a completely legaland proper way is simple. I intend to use a n Attorney( representing you as BENEFICIARY) to execute a seriesof affidavits in support of your claim. These will beapproved. The money transfer paperwork itself will include a certificate of origin so that the receiving bank does not ask questions or refuse the money as money laundering. Also, the paperwork will include proper certification that the funds being transferred are from non criminal sources. In short this will be a proper and legal money transfer and there is no risk!. I will have to process the initial paperwork to obtain approval from the Probate Registry ( Ministryof Justice ) to obtain the Letter of Administrationempowering you as Sole trustee/executor to the Estateof Mr. Mustafa. If you therefore agree to be the official Beneficiary, then please note that you will not be required to sign any Money Transfer Documents ( myAttorney will do all (that), you will not be requiredto come to South Africa. Only the following is required from you: (1) Send to me immediately A bank account ( a bank account with zero credit balance is ok) (2) Complete name and address of the Bank (3) Bank Account Number (4) Name of Account Holder/Beneficiary (5) Your address, phone and fax (6) A brief background information on you (CV) Once you send me the requested information as above, I will initiate the processing of the transferand in about 7 working days the money total USD52mwill be in your nominated bank account for us to sharein the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. Thistransaction is guaranteed to succeed without anyproblems. If you agree to assist me by sending me theabove requested information, I will give you mycomplete address, including phone/ fax etc and anyfurther clarifications you may require. Looking forward to your urgent reply. Yours truly Kambili. __________________________________________________Do You Yahoo!?Everything you'll ever need on one web pagefrom News and Sport to Email and Music Chartshttp://uk.my.yahoo.com\",\n",

       " {'content': 'FOREIGN PARTNERDear,\\r\\rNaturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise since we have not met, permit me however, I am Mr. Lawrence Abba, a Zimbabwean Farmer.\\r\\rI am contacting you as the need to for me to have a foreign partner in your country has become necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a private company in that region, as the present political instability in my country Zimbabwe, does not encourage financial investment as the environment is not conducive for investment and most of all security is not insured, just as reported by international media.  I got your contacts through personal research and out of desperation I decided to reach you through this medium. I will give you more information as regards to this as soon as you reply and I repose great confidence in you hence my approach due to security network place on us and I hope you will not let me out to security personal.\\r\\rThis problem started when the Zimbabwean government under the leadership of President Robert Mugabe announced a degree on May 31st 2000 to seize more than 849 white-owned farms.  So far, more than 1,400 white owned farms have been invaded and confiscated, as well as claiming the properties of the farmers. Consequently, most of my colleagues and our properties were seized again putting us to total confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the administration of President Mugabe in my country and we where subjected to psychological torture by the security agents in the country. Some of my friends are still under detention, although arrangements are being made for their release, now I have no confidence with anybody within my country.\\r\\rDuring these periods, as reported by some international media including the CNN, so many white farmers were killed, the government is not stopping at this, as just recently the government have asked all white-farmers to give up their farms to black farmers or risk going to prison. Having lived in this country Zimbabwe for so many years, I have no other country to go to, nor can I trace any of my distant relatives. Therefore, I decided to contact you, for your assistance, so that I can establish a company in your country and relocate there. Also, I must re-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your country to front as the owner of the enterprise, due to the fact that I am a foreigner.\\r\\rFor this purpose, I have put in a security deposit all monies from the sale of my farm and farming equipments (including tractors etc) which amounted to US$6.5Million, I had to move the money out of the country through a very secret arranged channel in a very unconventional method by my friend an official at the \"Security Minting  & Printing Company\" of my country.  Presently, the money is in an Oversea Country, under the custody of a private security firm whose name is withheld for now until we open communication.\\r\\rI will upon receiving your consent prepare every document to enable you receive this money on my behalf, pending my arrival to meet with you in your country so that we can both make further arrangements with regards to establishing the company.\\r\\rAs a partner you will be entitled to 20% stake in whichever company that you both decide to establish when I arrive your country.\\r\\rI am waiting urgently for your response and please treat with utmost confidentiality.\\r\\rBest Regards\\r\\r\\rLawrence Abba.\\r\\r\\r\\r',\n",

All 141\\rpassengers on board were feared dead.\\r\\rHe left in his domiciliary account the total sum of\\rSixty Five Million United States Dollars [$65million]\\rSince the management got the information of his\\rdeath we have been expecting any of his relation or\\rhis next of kin to come up and claim his money.\\rUnfortunately from the day of his death till the time\\rof this letter none of his relation or friends has\\rcome up for the claim. The banking and financial law\\rof Union bank of Nigeria Plc stipulates that if such\\rfund remained unclaimed after a period of four years (4) it\\rwill be transferred into the bank treasury as\\runclaimed bill. On this discovery sir, I and a colleague of mine\\rnow decided do business with you and\\rrelease the money to you as the next of kin to Ali B.\\rAshraf for safety and subsequent disbursement. I will\\rsoon proceed for my retirement in the middle of  this year, and I\\rpersonally do not want this fund to be transferred\\rinto the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. That is why\\rI wanted the fund to be move out of the bank before I\\rproceed on my retirement from the banking services by\\rjune 15th 2003.\\r\\rThe need for a foreigner as next of kin in this\\rproject is occasioned by the fact that the customer\\rMr. Ali Ashraf was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot\\rstand as his next of kin or heir. We have agreed that\\r15% of the Fund would be for you as foreign partner;\\rthereafter my colleague and I will visit your country\\rfor disbursement according to the percentages\\rindicated. To enable the immediate transfer of the\\rfund into your nominated account, you will first apply\\rto the bank as the next of kin of the deceased,\\rindicating your bank account number and location\\rwherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of\\ryour acknowledgement indicating your interest, I will\\rsend to you the text of the application that you will\\rsend to the Union Bank authority for an approval to\\rsubmit your claims.\\r\\rSend your reply through my direct  private email\\raddress and indicate  your direct\\rFax and telephone numbers for effective communication\\rthat this transaction is required. Do not reply through the\\runion bank email address because it will fall at the receptionist's\\rdesk and is for public use .\\r\\r\\rPlease note that you are not to appear in person, as\\revery thing regarding this project will be strictly on\\rdocumentations and every banking documents needed for\\rthis transaction will be taken care of by my self.\\r\\rLooking forward to urgently hearing from you.\\r\\rYours Faithfully\\r\\rMR.

This money came as a\\rresult of a pay-back contract deal between my late\\rhusband and a Russian firm in our country’s\\rMulti-billion dollar Ajaokuta Steel plant. The Russian\\rpartners returned my Husband’s share of\\rUS$55,000,000.00 U.S.D after his death, and lodged it\\rin my late husband’s Security company of which I am a\\rDirector Right now, the new Civilian Government has\\rintensified their probe on my late Husband’s Financial\\rresources and have frozen our accounts. In view of\\rthese facts, I acted fast to withdraw the\\rUS$55,000,000.00 U.S.D from the company’s vault and\\rdeposited it in a privately owned security safe in my\\rvillage. I have since declared the security company\\rbankrupt. No record whatsoever exists concerning the\\rmoney traceable by the Government because, there is no\\rdocumentation showing that we received the money from\\rthe Russians.\\r\\rDue to the current situation in the country concerning\\rthe Government’s attitude towards my husband, it has\\rbecome quite impossible for me to make use of this\\rmoney within; thus upon consent, I shall expect you to\\rcontact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail\\rabout this transaction.\\r\\rBearing in mind that your assistance is needed to\\rtransfer this fund, I propose a commission of 10% (ten\\rpercent) of the total sum to you for the expected\\rservices and assistance.

       " {'content': 'transparent enterprisesDear Sir, I am Sam Aluko, former special adviser on Petroleum matters to the late Head of State of Government of Nigeria Gen. Sani Abacha. Because of my strategic position in the former Government and also being a close confidant of the late Head of State, I was able to acquire personally the sum of $50,000,000.00 USD ( fifty million United States Dollars only) presently lodged in a Security Deposit in Europe. I made this money largely through \"CONSULTANCY FEE\" and Good Faith Fees\" paid by foreign Oil companies prior to Allocation of Deep Water Oil Blocs and other Lifting/prospecting Right. Nigeria is the 6th largest Producer/Exporter of Crude Oil in the World. As you are probably aware of the fact that Nigeria is prone to Military coups and the resultant Political/Economic Instability has fueled hyper Inflation, amongst other problems. I have therefore resolved to invest my money abroad, preferable in Real Estate Properties and Importation of Goods from your country for safety and optimum returns on Investment. However the, present civilian administration of President Olusegun Obasanjo has placed a restriction of movement on every member of the cabinet of the past military government. This is as a result of the panel of inquiry slated to investigate most of the atrocities perpetrated by the late former head of state. This means that I cannot travel out now till the panel conclude its investigations which only God knows when that would be. Straight transfer of this money into a bank abroad will present two major problems one, the tax incidence will be too high, as much as 60% of this money will go up in Taxes, Levies, Penalties etc. as a result of Government deliberate restrictions on flight of capital Abroad. However arrangement have been put in place for you to receive this money from a trust worthy security Deposit Company in Europe. As soon as you indicate your interest. I will send to you the security Code number, certificate of deposit number and airway bill number of the Deposit that will serve as the onus of proof to enable you claim the Money, which is tagged, Diplomatic Luggage. All I now need is an honest partner who can receive the money on my behalf and help me to invest as aforementioned. There is absolutely no risk involved in this transaction, as the money will be delivered to you in United States Dollars Bills. If you are interested in assisting me, please send to me by email immediately your preferred contact address where you can be reached at any time, upon receipt of the money, you are to lodge this money in a bank account and contact me for necessary arrangements for the investment of the funds. For your help and assistance in this deal, you will be entitled to 25% of this money in cash or Equity if you wish to join the proposed company. Finally you are to please urgently send to me through the required contact address that include your telephone and fax number), so that I can instruct the West side Deposit Company to go ahead with the transfer to you Best regards, Sam Aluko------------------------------------------------------------http://Game.37.com/  <--- Free Gameshttp://newJoke.com/   <---  J O K E S  ! ! !',\n",

So,I decided to contact you at\\ronce due to the urgency required for us to immediately\\rtransfer the said funds out of the country.\\r\\rDuring the time my father was in the government with\\rthe late General Sani Abacha as the head of state,they\\rwere both involved in several deals that yielded\\rBillions of Dollars. The prominent amongst the deals\\rwas monies that emanated from funds set aside for the\\rimportation of Arms and Ammunitions to boost the\\rNigerian Defense, funds set to embark on an oversea\\rampaign to counter the United States action to put a\\rstop to the self succession bid of the Abacha\\rgovernment to retain power, and monies set aside to\\rrehabilitate the ailing Nigerian Petroleum Refineries\\rand the National Electric Power Authority which\\rsupplies Electricity to the entire nation. If you are\\rconversant with world news, you would understand\\rbetter.\\r\\rDuring this period my father was able to make some\\rgood money for himself and kept in his private bank\\raccounts. The then head of state General Sani Abacha\\rtransferred his share of the money through a Lebanese\\rbusinessman, Chagoury and a Jewish businessman, Mark\\rRissar to bank accounts overseas. Unfortunately, all\\rthe secrets were revealed by the investigation\\ragencies set up by the successive governments and most\\rof the Abacha?s loots were traced and repatriated\\rfromthe various accounts to the Federal Government\\rTreasury.\\r\\rOut of the money my father made, he left the sum of\\rN50 Million (Fifty Million Naira) in the CBN escrow\\raccount for further transfer into a foreign account\\rand a sum of $25M (TWENTY-FIVE Million Dollars) was\\rkept in a Private security firm here in Nigeria.\\rThrough the confessions made by the Abacha?s Family,\\rthe N50 Million was recovered by the investigating\\ragency from the CBN escrow account. But were unable to\\rdiscover the $25M, which he kept in the vaults. The\\rreason is because no names were used to lodge in the\\rfunds.Instead, he used PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS\\r(PIN) and declared the contents as Bearer Bonds and\\rTreasury Bills. Also the firm issued him with a\\rcertificate of deposit of the consignments. Note thatI\\rhave these information in my custody.\\r\\rRight now, my father has been arrested and detained\\rfor interrogation. As the eldest son of my Father, I\\rbelieve that I owe the entire family an obligation to\\rensure that the $25M is successfully transferred\\rabroad for investment purposes. With the present\\rsituation, I cannot do it all by myself.\\r\\rIt is based on this that I am making this contact with\\ryou. I have done a thorough homework and fine-tuned\\rthe best wayto create you as the beneficiary to the\\rfunds and effect the transfer accordingly. Is rest\\rassured that the modalities I have resolved to\\rfinalize the entire project guarantees our safety and\\rthe successful transfer of the funds. So, you will be\\rabsolutely right when you say that this project is\\rrisk free and viable. If you are capable and willing\\rto assist,contact me at once via email for more\\rdetails.\\r\\rBelieve me, there is no one else we can trust gain.All\\rmy fathers friends have deserted us after exploiting\\rus on the pretence of trying to help my father. As it\\ris said, \"it is at the time of problems that you know\\ryour true friends\". So long as you keep everything to\\ryourself, we would definitely have no problems. For\\ryour assistance, I am ready to give you as much as 20%\\rof the total funds after transfer and invest a\\rreasonable percentage into any viable business you may\\rsuggest.\\r\\rPlease, I need your assistance to make this happen and\\rplease; do not undermine it because it will also be\\rasource of up liftment to you also.

Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black\\r Economic Empowerment Commission (Government) delegation on a trip to the United States during a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a business transaction hereunder for the benefit of all parties.\\r\\r Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of Project Implementation, with co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession, an overdue payment in US funds.\\r\\r The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials\\r over-invoiced to the amount of US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.\\r\\r The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, are the real engines for sustainable economic development, for which reason it has continued to encourage\\r investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close relationship, and a mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included our bills for approvals with the\\r co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA).\\r We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate a foreign account. The changing of beneficiary\\\\'s information/details and other forms of\\r documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and its approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or your good self.\\r I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that, should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be 20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so incurred.\\r It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies.\\r More often than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win major contracts, and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.\\r\\r This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to the successful\\r execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction.

       " {'content': 'VERY URGENT BUSINESS MATTERSDR. WILLIAMS BANIGOFEDERAL SECRETARIAT,LAGOS, NIGERIAEmail:  banigo@caramail.com             URGENT   &   CONFIDENTIALBest wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as contained in this letter.Before going into details of my proposal to you, I must first solicit you to treat it with  utmost confidentiality, as this is required for its success.My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of Nigeria�s Contracts Review Panel who are interested in diverting some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria.In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said floating funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this financial quarter.The source of the funds are as follows: During the last military regime, government officials awarded contracts that were grossly over-invoiced to Contractors.The present civilian government set up the Contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel,  to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts.My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and  members of this panel,we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of U.S.$16,500,000.00(sixteen Million,five hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars). That is why I am writing you this letter.We have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account,if you agree with our proposition as follows;(i) 10% to the account owner (you).(ii) 80% for us (the panel officials).(iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us )incidental to the actualisation of this project.We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them. Please note that this transactionis 100% safe and risk-free.We intend to effect the transfer within a few days from the date of receipt of the following information:Your name, company�s name, address and telephone and fax numbers, and your banking information. The above information will enable us write letters of claim andjob description respectively. This way, we will use your company�s name to apply for the payment and backdate the  award of the contract to your company.We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter and, I will bring you into a more detailedpicture of this transaction when I hear from you.Best regards,Dr. Williams BanigoPls.

       " {'content': \"Immediate Attention.From: Mr. Charles NwodoUniversal Trust Bank.website:www.utbplc.comDear friend,This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. The message could be strange but real if you pay some attention to it. I could have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity. Please accept my sincere apologies. In writing you this message, I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any embarrassment.  I am Mr. Charles Nwodo Manager with Universal Trust Bank  Plc. of Nigeria, Island Branch. I managed to get your contact details through the Internet myself. Time is of the importance and I am desperately looking for a person to assist me in this confidential business. A British oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Claude Brian Best made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit on January 6, 1999, valued at US$2,500,000.00 (Two Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars), for twelve (12) calendar months in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Claude Brian Best died in an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Claude Brian Best did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$2,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 4 (four) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Claude Brian Best so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.  We shall employ the service of two lawyers for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below; charlesnwodo@dr.com. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my email address .Thanks and regards. Mr. Charles Nwodo.\",\n",

       " {'content': \"Private Email Message.Good Day,With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation. My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla!nd) to seek for political asylum.I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam. President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here.I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.Your role in this project, is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.To know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate Angola, click on the links below and read. http://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.htmlhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_1839000/1839252.stmSincerely,O.C.Savimbi.\",\n",

       " {'content': \"GOOD DAY SIR\\rGreetings, My Friend,\\r\\rPermit me to introduce first myself then the purpose of this letter.\\r\\rI am Mr PAPA BELLO, Bank Manager of ORIENT BANK OF NIGERIA, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very\\rconfidential business proposition for you and it is carefully explained for your understanding as follows.\\r\\rOn June 6 1997, an American oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,\\rMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time account (Fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at\\rUS$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine\\rnotification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally\\rwe discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly\\rhas since died from an automobile accident.\\r\\rOn further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin\\rwere fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare\\rany next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of\\rUS$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of\\reach year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5\\r(five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.\\r\\rConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.\\rBarry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some undeserving and\\rcorrupt officials.\\r\\rThis is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with the following; your full names, date\\rand place of birth and complete address with confidential telephone and fax numbers so that the\\rattorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of\\rkin. We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the\\rnecessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.\\r\\rA bank account in any part of the world, which you would provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this\\rmoney to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share\\rin the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for\\rthis transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the\\rsuccessful execution of this transaction.\\r\\rIf you are interested, Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant\\rdocuments that will help you understand. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this\\rtransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest\\rmy share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via e-mail.\\r\\rThanks and regards,\\r\\rMr PAPA BELLO.\\r\\r\\r\\r\",\n",

But when President Kabila was killed in abloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before wewere schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately decided to divert the fund into a private securitycompany here in Congo for safe keeping. The securityof the said amount is presently being threatened herefollowing the arrest and seizure of properties of Col.Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila)a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel fromour same tribe, by the new President of the DemocraticRepublic of Congo, the son of late President LaurentKabila, Joseph Kabila. In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthyforeign partner who can assist us to move this moneyout of my country as the beneficiary.WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund underDiplomatic Cover to a security company in the europein your name. This is to ensure that the DiplomaticBaggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will notpass through normal custom/airport screening andclearance.Our inability to move this money out of Congo allThis while lies on our lack of trust on our supposedgood friends (western countries) who suddenly becamehostile to those of us who worked with the latePresident Kabila, immediately after his son tookoffice. Though we have neither seen nor met eachother, the information We gathered from an associatewho has worked in your country has encouraged andconvinced us that with your sincere assistance, thistransaction will be properly handled with modestyand honesty to a huge success within two weeks. Thesaid money is a state fund and therefore requires atotal confidentiality.Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fundout of Congo, you can contact me through my emailaddress above with your telephone, fax number andpersonal information to enable us discuss themodalities and what will be your share(percentage) for assisting us.I must use this opportunity and medium to implore Youto exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matterextraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision,while I await your prompt response.

However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation. My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla!nd) to seek for political asylum.I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam. President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here.I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.Your role in this project, is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.To know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate Angola, click on the links below and read. http://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.htmlhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_1839000/1839252.stmSincerely,O.C.Savimbi.\",\n",

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable person to handle a very confidential transaction that involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. It may sound strange but exercise patience and read on.

Contract for the Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries in the country~ US$ 152Million. 3. The construction of storage tanks for petroleum products (Depots) US$240 Million.

       " {'content': 'HELLOFROM : MR TUNDA USENI EMAIL ADDRESS: tunda@zapo.net URGENT BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP ATTENTION:PRESIDENT/C.E.O      Dear Sir, My name is MR TUNDA USENI the eldest son of Rtd General JEREMAIAH. J. T. USENI who was the est. while Minister of the Federal Capital territory Abuja in the late General Sani Abacha\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Regime of 1993- 1998. I am contacting you in a benevolent spirit; utmost confidence and trust to enable us provide a solution to a money transfer of $60M that is presently putting my entire family into great disarray. You may be quite surprised at my sudden contact to you but do not despair, I got your contact from a business site on the internet and following the information I gathered about you, I was convinced that you could be of assistance to me. So, decided to contact you at once due to the urgency required for us to immediately transfer the said funds out of the country. During the time my father was in the government with the late General Sani Abacha as the head of state, they were both involved in several deals that yielded Billions of Dollars. The prominent amongst the deals was monies that emanated from funds set aside for the importation of Arms and Ammunitions to boost the Nigerian Defense, funds set to embark on an oversea campaign to counter the United States action to put a stop to the self succession bid of the Abacha\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s government to retain power, and monies set aside to rehabilitate the ailing Nigerian Petroleum Refineries and the National Electric Power Authority which supplies Electricity to the entire nation. If you are conversant with world news, you would understand better. During this period my father was able to make some good money for himself and kept in his private bank accounts. The then head of state General Sani Abacha transferred his share of the money through a Lebanese businessman, Chagoury and a Jewish businessman, Mark Rissar to bank accounts overseas. Unfortunately, all the secrets were revealed by the investigation agencies set up by the successive governments and most of the Abacha\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s loots were traced and repatriated from the various accounts to the Federal Government Treasury. Out of the money my father made, he left the sum of N50 Million (Fifty Million Naira) in the CBN escrow account for further transfer into a foreign account and a sum of $60M (Sixty Million Dollars) was kept in a Private security firm here in Nigeria. Through the confessions made by the Abacha\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Family, the N50 Million was recovered by the investigating agency from the CBN escrow account. But were unable to discover the $60M, which he kept in the vaults. The reason is because no names were used to lodge in the funds. Instead, he used PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS (PIN) and declared the contents as Bearer Bonds and Treasury Bills. Also the firm issued him with a certificate of deposit of the consignments. Note that I have these information in my custody. Right now, my father has been arrested and detained for interrogation. As the eldest son of my Father, I believe that I owe the entire family an obligation to ensure that the $60M is successfully transferred abroad for investment purposes. With the present situation, I cannot do it all by myself. It is based on this that I am making this contact with you. I have done a thorough homework and fine-tuned the best way to create you as the beneficiary to the funds and effect the transfer accordingly. Is rest assured that the modalities I have resolved to finalize the entire project guarantees our safety and the successful transfer of the funds. So, you will be absolutely right when you say that this project is risk free and viable. If you are capable and willing to assist, contact me at once via email for more details. Believe me, there is no one else we can trust again. All my fathers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' friends have deserted us after exploiting us on the pretence of trying to help my father. As it is said, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"it is at the time of problems that you know your true friends\\\\\\\\\\\\\". So long as you keep everything to yourself, we would definitely have no problems. For your assistance, I am ready to give you as much as 20% of the total funds after transfer and invest a reasonable percentage into any viable business you may suggest. Please, I need your assistance to make this happen and please; do not undermine it because it will also be a source of up liftment to you also. You have absolutely nothing to loose in assisting us instead, you have so much to gain. Awaiting your urgent and positive response.

We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of thisfinancial quarter.The source of the funds are as follows: During the last military regime,government officials awarded contracts that were grossly over-invoiced to Contractors.The present civilian government set up the Contract ReviewPanel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments madeavailable to it by the decree setting up the panel,  to review thesecontracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts.My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready fordisbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes.However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and  members ofthis panel,we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names ofcompanies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliableoverseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum ofU.S.$16,500,000.00(sixteen Million,five hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars).That is why I am writing you this letter.We have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account,if you agree with our proposition as follows;(i) 10% to the account owner (you).(ii) 80% for us (the panel officials).(iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us)incidental to the actualisation of this project.We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreignstock markets and other business till we are ready and able to haveaccess to them. Please note that this transactionis 100% safe andrisk-free.We intend to effect the transfer within a few days from thedate of receipt of the following information:Your name, company�s name, address and telephone and fax numbers, andyour banking information. The above information will enable us writeletters of claim andjob description respectively. This way, we will useyour company�s name to apply for the payment and backdate the  award ofthe contract to your company.We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicitfor your utmost confidentiality in this transaction.

I have decided to seek a confidential\\r co-operation with you in execution of a business\\r transaction hereunder for the benefit of all\\r parties.\\r\\r Within the Department of Mining Resources where I\\r work as the Director of Project Implementation, with\\r co-operation of two other top officials, we have in\\r our possession, an overdue payment in US funds.\\r\\r The said funds represent certain percentage of the\\r contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by\\r a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials\\r over-invoiced to the amount of US$14,300,000.00\\r (Fourteen  Million, Three Hundred Thousand United\\r States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has\\r been paid to the original contractor, leaving the\\r excess balance unclaimed.\\r\\r The Government of the Republic of South Africa\\r believe that private investment in general, and\\r foreign direct investment in particular, are the\\r real engines for sustainable economic development,\\r for which reason it has continued to encourage\\r investment in the key growth-oriented sector of\\r Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign\\r contractors all debts owed to them, so as to\\r continue to enjoy close relationship, and a mutually\\r beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and\\r non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we\\r included our bills for approvals with the\\r co-operation of some officials at the Department of\\r Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA).\\r We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary\\r of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to\\r operate a foreign account. The changing of\\r beneficiary's information/details and other forms of\\r documentation upon application for claim to reflect\\r the contract money and its approvals will be secured\\r on behalf of your company or your good self.\\r I have the authority of my colleagues involved to\\r propose that, should you be willing to assist us in\\r this transaction your share as compensation will be\\r 30% while my colleagues and I shall receive 60%, and\\r the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all\\r expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so\\r incurred.\\r\\r It does not matter whether or not your company does\\r contract projects of the nature described here. The\\r assumption is that your company won the major\\r contract and subcontracted it to other companies.\\r More often than not, big trading companies and firms\\r of unrelated fields win major contracts, and\\r subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.\\r\\r This business itself is 100% safe, provided you\\r treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your\\r pecialization is not a hindrance to the successful\\r execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction.

Farouk Al-Bashar, I represent my family as the oldest son of the Al-Bashar family, who are the descendants of Ibrahim Al-Bashar Ali from one of the oil rich areas in Iraq. Over the years my family has acquired huge sums of money from royalties for the exploration of oil in our region but over the past 15 years, Saddam Hussein and his gangs of bandits have taken our oils without payments and we can not complain as those who did are all dead. In the wake of the Gulf War of 1990, our family withdrew most moneys that remain in coded bank accounts that Saddam did not find and we hide it in a secret chamber underground, where it remained safe until after the war. At the end of Gulf war, we moved the funds into a private vault of a security company in Baghdad, where it was until we collected it a few days ago on the fear of the eminent war with America.We pray they remove Saddam as he is the cause of much hardship here, but our funds are trapped here and there is no avenue to transfer any amount from Iraq without Saddam knowing. The problem now is how do we transfer the funds totalling US$12.5 Million in cash from here.We are afraid that with the capacity of the bombs America is coming to Baghdad with nowhere would be safe for the money, so we need you to help in securing a private collection agency who would come to Iraq and collect the money and have them moved to the west, where our family is planning to relocate to as life in Iraq is no longer worth living because of Saddam.I have to travel lots of miles each day to send an email hoping someone out there would assist this family, if you can we will give you the details of an agency that can lift the funds from here as given to me by a US Marine. The private collection agency would then collect the fund from here and deliver it to you for safe keep. Hoping the American campaign would be successful, we would then come over to your countryfor a meeting to share the funds and hopefully start a new life with you as a partner.For your assistance with this project the family is willing to give you 10% of the funds, however if this does not suit you we are open for negotiation.We eagerly await your response so we can inform you of the next line of action.Regards.Eng.

       " {'content': \"Re: Iraq10 Jasim Street,Ibrahim'Ali, Baghdad, Iraq.Email: falbashar@olumo.netRe: Urgent Assistance NeededBy way of introduction I am Eng. Farouk Al-Bashar, I represent my family as the oldest son of the Al-Bashar family, who are the descendants of Ibrahim Al-Bashar Ali from one of the oil rich areas in Iraq. Over the years my family has acquired huge sums of money from royalties for the exploration of oil in our region but over the past 15 years, Saddam Hussein and his gangs of bandits have taken our oils without payments and we can not complain as those who did are all dead. In the wake of the Gulf War of 1990, our family withdrew most moneys that remain in coded bank accounts that Saddam did not find and we hide it in a secret chamber underground, where it remained safe until after the war. At the end of Gulf war, we moved the funds into a private vault of a security company in Baghdad, where it was until we collected it a few days ago on the fear of the eminent war with America.We pray they remove Saddam as he is the cause of much hardship here, but our funds are trapped here and there is no avenue to transfer any amount from Iraq without Saddam knowing. The problem now is how do we transfer the funds totalling US$12.5 Million in cash from here.We are afraid that with the capacity of the bombs America is coming to Baghdad with nowhere would be safe for the money, so we need you to help in securing a private collection agency who would come to Iraq and collect the money and have them moved to the west, where our family is planning to relocate to as life in Iraq is no longer worth living because of Saddam.I have to travel lots of miles each day to send an email hoping someone out there would assist this family, if you can we will give you the details of an agency that can lift the funds from here as given to me by a US Marine. The private collection agency would then collect the fund from here and deliver it to you for safe keep. Hoping the American campaign would be successful, we would then come over to your countryfor a meeting to share the funds and hopefully start a new life with you as a partner.For your assistance with this project the family is willing to give you 10% of the funds, however if this does not suit you we are open for negotiation.We eagerly await your response so we can inform you of the next line of action.Regards.Eng. Farouk Al- BasharFor the entire Al-Bashar family\",\n",

INVESTMENT OFFER         Dear Sir,In appreciation of your esteemed contact receivedthrough a reliable source and the choice of yourcountry I wish to introduce myself, I am Mr.JamesKabila the son of the late Democratic Republic ofCongo President Laurent Desire Kabila of the blessedmemory.I know this letter might come to you as asurprise butI honestly do not intend to surprise you.I write this letter in respect of my intention toinvest the sum of US$35M(Thirty Five Million UnitedState Dollars) with you.I inherited this money from mymother. This money was got through the smuggling andsales of Diamond and Timber when my father was thehead of state. My mother though not her legal wifeused her privilege position to engage in the businessof Diamond and Timber since she knows that hersurvival will depend on how much she can get out ofthe privilege situation.   When my father wasassassinated on 16TH Jan. 01 by one of his bodyguardsLt. Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of sometop army officers that wanted to topple him. I escapedto Madrid, Spain because of the fear that I might bearrested by my half brother Lt.General Joseph Kabilathe present head of state.Actually his mother and mymother are not in the best of relationship because ofwho among them will be the first lady tussle and thisultimately affected us their children.My motheradvised me to leave For Madrid, Spain where thesefunds were deposited for safe keeping with a PrivateSecurity Company here in Spain.On getting to  Spainwhere I have been living since then as a politicalrefugee, I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who cancome down to Madrid, Spain for a meeting and to clearthe funds in his name as the sole beneficiary of theConsignment as I was afraid of being defraud. HonestlyI contacted you because I don't want to invest thismoney in Madrid Spain due to my status here as apolitical Refugee. And moreover I wouldn't want totake risk because this money is all that my Mother andI are depending on. My step brother Joseph,who is nowthe present leader of my country has seized all myfather's assets and money. He left us empty handedwithout knowing about this funds deposited with theSecurity Company here. That is why I decided thatinvesting this money abroad should be the bestinvestment for me. I will be honored if I can be giventhe privilege of investing this money with you. Iexpect you to be trust worthy and kind enough torespond to this distress call to save My Mother and Ifrom a hopeless future. And if you agree, I herebyagree to compensate your sincere and candid effort inthis regard with 15% of the total amount of $35million US Dollars. When the money ($35 million) ismoved into your discrete account. You will be allowedto draw 15% in your favor, while the remaining 85%will be invested meaning fully for our future ifpossible in your area of business and differentsectors of the Economy in your country which aredividends yielding.Whatever your decision is pleasereach me immediately,and keep this letter tight secretfor the interest of my Family.Best regards, Mr.James Kabila. ___________________________________________________Yahoo!

On the 6th of June 1998 an American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with us andhis present balance is valued at US$28,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) in my Bank. We sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, wesent a reminder and finally, we discovered from his employers that he died from an automobile accident. On furtherinvestigation, we found out from his account file that he never made a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin wasfruitless, as he had none. We therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents in the bank files. This sum of $28,500,000.00 is still lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest is being rolled over at the end of every year. As it is now, no one will ever come forward to claim this money. According to the Nigeria law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if unclaimed. Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers. This is simple; all we need is some of your details so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which wouldput you in place as Mr. Myers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services of an accredited Attorney for the draftingand notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letters of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. The money would be shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you.There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as a manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via email.Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for us. I shall still require your assistance to invest my own share in your country just incase you can help, otherwise we'll take our share . Awaiting your urgent reply.Mr.Dayo Naps234 80 372 20807\",\n",

       " {'content': \"Private Email to you.Your strictest confidentiality and kind consideration highly required.Greetings to you,With warm heart I offer my friendship, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this letter might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. Also I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation. My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla! nd) to seek for political asylum.I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam. President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here.I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.Your role in this project, is acting on my behalf as a trustee to claim the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15 %($2,775,000) of the money. I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit, which is in my name, and will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me on my private email address; olivsav@netscape.net  whether or not you are interested in assisting us. This will enable us make alternative plans, in the event of non-interest on your part.

I have been working with this company for over ten years. Within this period, I have watched with meticulous precision how African Heads of State and Government functionaries have been using global security & finance Ltd. to move sums of money USD, pounds sterling, French francs (cash) to their foreign partners.

Their foreign partners, friends and relatives are claiming most of these consignments. A lot of them are lying here unclaimed for as much as eight years. Nobody will ever come for them because in most cases, the certificate of Deposit are never available to any body except the depositors or with me hence most of them are dead. I have Re-deposited all these overstayed consignment into the Vault Facility of Reputable Bank in Ghana waiting to hear from you. Since the inception of the year 2000, our company's management has changed the procedure of claims of consignment, as soon as you are able to produce the secret information as contained in the secret file of any consignment, it will be released to you upon demand.

It will be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.My name is Mr.Mako Okere, the first son of Iko Okere,one of the most popular black farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict, I decided to contact you through email, after searching for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons. However,I apologize if this is not acceptable to you.The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a business venture. Due to the the land and political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my father forsaw the danger that came in Zimbabwe. Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business foreign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in major companies. We then went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred thousand US dollars), in a private security company. This money was deposited with this Private Security company for safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in Botswana and Swaziland.President Mugabe's support for the violent imbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to the murder of my beloved father and other innocent lives. I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but when the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe to South Africa where I was arrested and detained for eight(8 good month)in jail.I fled south Africa for The Netherlands with the help of the present prison command chief officer in Charge(P.C.C.O)I am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security company from South Africa, has a branch here, and they have moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg here. I need to transfer this money to an account and invest part of the money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial ransaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can be transferred, ence this proposal to you.You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money. If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to assist with the arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company from their office here in The Netherlands, as it has now been transfered from Johannesburg, South Afri! ca to their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you representing me.For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your assistance, and helping me open an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply.I have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4% ($580,000,00) for Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 10% for assisting with opening an account, then 85%will be left in the account here for me.Please, I want you to maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction.I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you inadvance as I anticipate your co-operation.Thanks and God bless.Sincerely,Mako Okere\",\n",

I am writing you to earnestly Solicit your assistance in helping toreceive some sum of money. I got your e-mail address onthe Internet while searching for a reliable and reputableperson to handle this transaction.THE PROPOSITION: We have the sum of US$9,000,000.00 (Nine MillionDollars) that we intend to transfer overseas through the assistance ofa foreign partner.This money came as a result of the unclaimed pension funds belonging to a British expatriate petroleum engineer with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,Engr.John Bruno.After all other pensioners have been paid their entitlements,we deposited this unclaimed sum of US$9,000,000.00,with the Debt Reconciliation Committee. In a bid to make sure Engr.John Bruno gets his due,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Engr.John Bruno died,from an automobile accident.On further investigation, I found out thathe died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next ofkin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discoveredthat Engr.John Bruno did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents.This sum of US$9,000,000.00 is still sitting in anaccount of the Debt Reconciliation Committee and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law,at the expiration of 2 (two) years,the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreignerto stand in as the next of kin to Engr.John Bruno so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.This is simple, I will like you to provideimmediately your full names,address,telephone and fax numbers so that I can prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin to Engr Bruno.Upon this,we would then obtain the letter of probate/administration in your favor from a Federal High Court.A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me and my partners,30% for you and 5% for any expences incured,during the course of this transaction.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction willbe done at the high court and my position as the Chairman of the Committee guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.The fund shall be transferred to you legally in accordance to all laid down procedures governing transfer of funds.If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address. Upon your response, I shall then provide you withmore details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Awaiting your urgent reply via my email address.Thanks and regards,Sen.Gbenga Aluko\",\n",

       " {'content': \"PRIVATE EMAIL MESSAGE.Good day, This email message requires your utmost confidentiality. It is with warm heart I am offering you my friendship, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. I know this is a most unusual way to contact you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, but I am humbly asking that you take due consideration of the importance of my proposal and the immense benefit in it for you. Also I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my intensive and desperate search for a partner, hence this email to you. I crave your indulgence to read this carefully, in order to have a general overview of my situation. My Uncle was killed in a surprise attack by government troops of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried UNITA with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose Dembo and assume leadership in order to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my Uncle who is my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in the war. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came her! e (Holland) to seek for political asylum. I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a Private Security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the safety deposit containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland to seek for political asylum here, is the location of the Security Company here in Amsterdam. Since President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and he has already done this in Angola, I cannot lodge the funds in my name any where in the world at the moment. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here on arrival last year. I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that this kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part in order not to lose this money. Please ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. Your role in this project, is to act on my behalf as a trustee to claim the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, since I can not participate in any business activity or open a bank account here as a political asylum seeker. After the safety deposit is claimed, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction. My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15 %($2,775,000) of the money. I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit and the release codes of the vaults for the safety deposit, which is in my name, and will be used for claim from the security company. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you. This transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response. I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me on my private email address; olivsav@netscape.net  whether or not you are interested in assisting us. This will enable us make alternative plans, in the event of non-interest on your part.

       " {'content': 'urgent responseSTRICTLY CONFIDENTIALMy dear Friend, I am highly compelled upon strict recommendation, to write you this very urgent and confidential letter.I do hope my letter will not embarrass yousince I had no previous correspondence with you.I hope this mail will not come to you as a surprise.I am sending this proposal with due sense of humanity, responsibility andwith few awareness that you will give it a sympathetic attention. I regreet the inconvenience it may cause you base on the condition that we have not met before. I am Mrs. Salatu Mustapha, the wife of Al Mustapha, personal assistant to the Late head of state of Federal Republic of Nigeria - General Sani Abacha.I am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other like wise developing a cordial relationship.My husband along with the head of state and top officials of their past administration has been accused of looting several Billion United States Dollars from the Nigeria Government. The current attitude of the present government towards my family has indeed made life quite unbearable for us.Fortunately, Al Mustapha my Husband has Six million and eight hundred thousand United States Dollars(US$6.8 million) cash, which he intended to use for investment purposes overseas. This money is kept in a private security company. This money was deposited for safe keeping in the security vault of a freighting agency here by my husband preparotry to being air lifted abroad for investment purposes before his arrest leaving a clause that it could only be claimed by an expertriate partner. It is only my husband and myself that know where the money is kept. Due to the current situation in the country concerning government�s vendettas towards my family, we seek your assistance to transfer this money out of Nigeria for the purpose of investment as intended by my husband.Note that my family is currently being probed by this present government for alleged involvement in misappropriation of public funds during their regime.Towards this effect, an embargo restricting my family members from traveling or carrying outfinancial transactions without their express permission is in force.Right now, my husband (Al Mustapha) is under arrest and is being detained inconnection to the above and other activities of his late Boss.However, I have an arrangement on how to freight this money to you after receiving some assurances from you of the safety our own share and that you will only take the commission that we will offer you.This money personally belongs to my husband and he intends that it still be used for investment. No record ever existed concerning this money, neither is the money traceable by the government because thereis no Documentation concerning the funds in the Federal Treasury. The freighting company to be used has now been introduced to me and as soon as we recieve your readiness to assist us recieve this fund we shall formalize the deposit documents in your name and reach an agreement withthem to air lift the consignment for your pick up.Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, we propose a commission of 15%(Fifteen Percent) of the total sum to you for the expected services and assistance. While 5% is mapped outfor miscellaneous expenses.On your positive consent, I shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss about this.Your urgent response is highly needed. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, while I await your prompt response.Best regards,MRS.

       " {'content': \"ASSISTANCE NEEDEDHello,\\rI am sorry for the embarrassment this letter might cause you as we have not had any correspondence before this letter. I got your address through my nephew   with Nigerian Military Chamber of Commerce industry and Mining during my research for a reliable and trustworthy partner who l can do business with though l did not disclose the nature of the business l intend to do with whoever he recommend for me.\\rI am DR. MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigeria Head of State, General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other likeness developing a cordial relationship.\\rI currently have within my reach the sum of Twenty - Five Million US Dollars (US$25,000,000.00) cash which l intends to use for investment, like Real Estate Development specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries Multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant.\\rThe Russian Partners returned my husband's Share of USD$25,000,000.00 after the death of my husband and Lodged in my husband's Security Company of which l am director right now, the new Civilian Government have intensified their probe on my husband? Financial and oil company. In view of these, l acted fast to withdraw the US$25,000,000.00 from the company vault and deposited it in a Security Company. I have since declared the Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the Russian.\\rDue to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within. Let me refer you to the front page of this day newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it through their website www.thisdayonline.com the present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all our bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad.Thus consent l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction.Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, I proposed a percentage of 30% of the total sum to you for the expected service and assistance, 15% for offsetting minor expenses incurred in the  course of this transaction. Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop further contacts. All correspondence must be by the email address mariamabacha200@ecplaza.net I will give you my Tel numbers where you can contact me when I hear from you.\\rI must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential whatever your decision while await your prompt response.\\rNB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family, l has decided that this transaction exist between you and my nephew Dr. Azeez Bello. Remember to include your private Tel/fax or mobile number for easy communication.\\rBest Regards.\\rDR. (MRS) MARIAM ABACHA\\r\",\n",

It will be surprising  to you to\\rreceive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally.\\rHowever, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction,\\rwhich I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.  My name\\ris  Owen Mubane, the first son of Mapele Mubane, of the  most popular\\rblack farmer  from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land  dispute in my\\rcountry. As led by my instict, I decided to contact you  through email,\\rafter searching  for contacts via the internet, as it  is the only means\\rI can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties  with Zimbabwe for\\rsecurity and safety reasons.  However, I apologize  if this is not\\racceptable to you.\\r\\r\\rThe purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in  a\\rbusiness venture. Due to the land and political problems in  Zimbabwe,\\ras a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of  new Land Act\\rReform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the  few rich black\\rfarmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life,  my father for saw\\rthe danger that came in Zimbabwe. Before he was  murdered, he withdrew\\rall of our business foreign accounts in dollars  and sold up our shares\\rin major companies. We then went to  SOUTH AFRICA  to deposit the sum of\\rUS$14.5 million  (Fourteen million, Five Hundred thousand US dollars),\\rin a private  security company. This money was deposited with this\\rPrivate Security  company for safety and security reasons, and  was to\\rbe used for the  purchase of land, new machines and chemicals\\restablishment of new  farms in Europe.\\r\\r\\rPresident Mugabe's support for the violent  Zimbabwean war veterans  and\\rsome lunatics in the society, led to the murder of my beloved  father\\rand other innocent lives. I was continually threatened to  abandon my\\rinheritance from my father after he was murdered. I  resited for a\\rwhile, but when the danger became unbearable, and I  survived two murder\\rattempts, I fled Zimbabwe.  I am currently staying in the Netherlands\\rwhere I am seeking  political asylum. In fact my decision to come here\\rto seek asylum, is  because the security company from South Africa, has\\ra branch here,  and they have moved the deposit from their office in\\rJohannesburg down  here. I need to transfer this money to  an account\\rand invest part of  the money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a\\rrefugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial\\rtransaction, this is why  I am seeking a genuine and reliable  partner,\\rwhose account this money can be transferred, hence this  proposal to\\ryou.You have to understand that this decision taken by me  entrusts my\\rfuture and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping  of this\\rmoney. If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for  me, is to\\rassist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the  security company\\rfrom their office here in The Netherlands, as it has  now been\\rtransfered from Johannesburg, South Afri!  ca to their branch here. The\\rcompany will be legally informed of you  representing me.\\r\\r\\rFor your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can\\rchoose to have 10% of the money for your assistance, and helping me\\ropen an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go  into\\rpartnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the  money\\rin your country.

I am Muhammed Abacha the the son of the late military head of state General Sani Abacha who died mysteriously on the 8th of June 1998. Following the death of my father Gen. Sani Abacha,elections were successfully held in the country and a civilian administration was sworn into power with the assistance of the American Government under the leadership of President Clinton. With the advent of the new democratic administration, a decision was taken by the new presidentof Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo to probe and ultimately prosecute all past military officers and their cohorts that served in very strategic capacities in the last military regime of my father.I was among those singled out to to be punished after a makeshift trial,for the supposed deeds of my dad,ever since I have been in detention(the past 3 years).On monday the 24 September 2002,I was released,on the condition that I will release the rest of my fathers money in my care,to the tune of $I.5b,which I agreed. Now I have been released but kept under severe house arrest,I had amassed monies running into hundreds of millions of dollars stashed in various private foreign accounts around the world,most of wish have been frozen. Presently, I am confined under house arrest after my recent release from detention and I am now constrained into seeking for this assistance today because I cannot afford to let this goverment know that I still have funds stashed away. Shortly, before my detention I hurriedly deposited the sum of USD35.5 m illion with a security deposit firm for safekeeping,hence my seeking your assistance to receive this fund. I have since hadthis amount stashed away in a private security company in Europe. I cannot send this money to any of my Bank Account abroad or open a new account for reasons mentioned earlier.I hereby seek your assistance in moving and securing this money in your account abroad. I will adequately compensate you with 15% of the total sum for your assistance and co-operation with me to move this fund to your account for safe keeping where I can easily utilise it. The present administration has beamed their search light on any body remotely related to me and my family and you strongly know for certain that I am under surveillance and I cannot operate any of my bank accounts any more, due to their being frozen. I intend to safeguard and invest this amount of money abroad, but with a reliable foreign business partner so that we can invest the funds in doing business in your country. That is why I am soliciting your assistance and cooperation as regards this business.Arrangements are being concluded with the Security Company which has branches in Europe to receive the money in cash.

I was moved by the recommendations made\\rof your sincerity to handle a business relationship that involves huge money on trust. I was\\rconstrained by the sudden death of my husband, the former Minister of Power and steel and\\rcurrently before his death, the Minister for Justice of my country, whom was assassinated by an\\runknown men.\\r\\rI am Mrs. Amina Ige, the second wife of the late Mr. Bola Ige who died on December 23rd 2001.\\rWith heart full of grief, I regret to inform you of the inhumane and harsh conditions which my\\rhusband's first wife and the brother's have subjected me and my only son, Mr.Ahmed J. Bola Ige\\r(Jr.).Since my husband's death, the relatives have been wicked to us because of the following\\rreasons:\\r\\r1. I am not from the same tribe with them.\\r2. My refusal to learn and speak their tribal language and dress like other women from their tribe.\\r3. My refusal to accept their religion\\r4. Because I have only one child, a male child.\\r5. Because I was specially loved and favored by my late husband.\\r\\rI am absolutely tired of all these threats from my husband’s relatives since the death of my\\rhusband. I am no longer in their Family house. I am now in my husband's guesthouse, with my Son,\\rI seriously need your kind assistance and co-operations.  Few weeks before my husband's death,\\rhe entrusted the cash sum of $85 million U.S dollars to my care for safe keeping in my apartment.\\rAfter his death I acted fast to deposit in a private security company vault to avoid my husband's\\rrelations getting to see it in the house. This sum is secretly concealed in boxes.\\r\\rNow I solicit your assistance to accept this sum for self-keeping. This I cannot lodge into a\\rlocal bank account to avoid suspicion from the Government, my husband's brother's and wife\\rsince they have Confiscated all that is left by my husband and still places eyes on me if they\\rcould lay hands on more including cash as they have left me and my child without any cash. If you\\rcan accept this, I urge you to contact us immediately for us to brief you on arrangement on how\\rwe can possibly handle this. As a necessity you will also assist us in buying a good building in\\ryour city as we are presently in the guesthouse. Since I am interested in investing on Farm,\\rEstate development, Shares/stock exchange market, computers and in the shipping Industries.\\rI will like you to educate me on your country's companies Income -tax policies, as a citizen\\rsince my husband's oil allocation from Federal Government is still in force.\\r15% of the tatal money will be your commission, 5% for expenses and 80% for my family.\\rObviously, you will be our (Myself and Son) next of kin while in your country. I expect you to\\rgive this a quick and urgent attention while I expect your response for more briefing from me,\\rbut if on the other hand you consider your self not capable and fit of handling this because of\\rthe volume of cash involved, you can hold confidential by informing me, hence I may approve your\\rcontact of any of your trusted close confidant you feel can keep this confidential and capable of\\rhandling such because of his level of knowledge in investment and cash flow in business.\\rRemember the confidentiality, as this is not for any third party, hence this should remain\\rbetween both of us alone.

       " {'content': \"I AWAIT YOUR REPLY.Dear Sir,You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. I am Gabriel Kali, the first son of Gadik kali, one of the most popular black farmers in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact through network online hence decided to write you. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US15.5 million (FIFTEEN MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob!  action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims. It is against this background that, my family and I fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Nigeria where we are seeking political asylum and however have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. Since the law of this country prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone. As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of this country for!  fear of going through the same experience in future, both countries have similar political history. I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here as I have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa. But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of thi! s transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 15% of the money while the remaining 80% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me with the above E-mail address while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. Thanks, GOD BLESS YOU Yours Faithfully, GABRIEL KALI.\",\n",

My name is Saidi Fatou, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer which was discovered very late, due to my laxity incarrying for my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing Icared for. But now I regret all this as I now knowthat there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God ! has called me, I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of twenty four million dollars that I have with a Bank in london. I will want you to help me collect this deposit anddispatched it to charity organizations.email me at giversworld@fastermail.com I have set aside 10% for you for your time and patience.God be with you.

My colleagues have\\rassigned me to seek for assistance of a reliable foreigner through whom we can transfer the\\rsum of US $65,500,000.00 (sixty Five Million, five Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) which\\rarose from deliberate over- inflated contract value for the General expansion of the Kanji\\rDam Thermal Station on behalf of National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) for increased\\renergy generation to Nigeria and some other West African Countries. The Contract was\\rawarded in 1998 during the late General Sanni Abacha regime to an expatriate firm with the\\rconsideration of 10% commission agreement on the total contract value. The contract has\\rbeen completed and the contractor has long been paid, we are now left with this\\rUS$65,500,000.00 representing the 10% our own share as agreed presently in the Federal\\rGovernment account. The favorable political/economic climate in this country now presented\\ran opportunity for this money to be transferred out of the country. I got your contact from a\\rcommercial attached to your emabassy. This assurance gave me courage to link you up for\\rthis particular transaction, and I hope it will be of mutual benefit to all of us. Our contact in\\rthe Federal Ministry of Finance have given us a go a head advice to begin the process of the\\rremittance, hence we have set in motion the machinery for the take off of the transaction and\\rfurther action will commence immediately we hear from you. We have agreed that after the\\rtransfer of the money into your account, you shall be entitled to 30% of the total amount\\rtransferred, 10% for incidental expenses from you and us, while the remaining 60% will be\\rfor us. We decided to give you this percentage in order to motivate you and also to let you\\rfeel satisfied at the end of this transaction. The nature of your business is not particularly\\rrelevant for the success of this transaction. All we require is your willingness to co-operate\\rand assurance that our own share will be given to us when this money is transferred into your\\raccount. All necessary precautions have been taken to ensure a no risk situation on the sides\\rof both parties and it is believed that the conclusion of this transaction will not last more than\\rfourteen (14) working days. However, we are going to retrieve the whole documents that will\\rbe related to this transaction so that both parties will be protected after the transfer of the\\rmoney into your account. Since we have no knowledge of business, our plan is to invest this\\rmoney into Real Estate, Stocks and we can also invest in some other profitable business in\\ryour country based on your advice because many of our years has been spent as Civil\\rServant, and we may likely resign from government service to private businesses after this\\rmoney is transferred into your Account.

Please reply this\\rmail through chuksanths@zwallet.com <mailto:chuksanths@zwallet.com>.\\r\\r\\r\\rBest Regards\\rMr Chuks Anthony\\rNEPA\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\rINVESTMENT ASSISTANCE.\\r\\rI am Mr Chuks Anthony, the financial Controller and Contract Award Committee Chairman\\rin the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) in Lagos, Nigeria. My colleagues have\\rassigned me to seek for assistance of a reliable foreigner through whom we can transfer the\\rsum of US $65,500,000.00 (sixty Five Million, five Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) which\\rarose from deliberate over- inflated contract value for the General expansion of the Kanji\\rDam Thermal Station on behalf of National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) for increased\\renergy generation to Nigeria and some other West African Countries. The Contract was\\rawarded in 1998 during the late General Sanni Abacha regime to an expatriate firm with the\\rconsideration of 10% commission agreement on the total contract value. The contract has\\rbeen completed and the contractor has long been paid, we are now left with this\\rUS$65,500,000.00 representing the 10% our own share as agreed presently in the Federal\\rGovernment account. The favorable political/economic climate in this country now presented\\ran opportunity for this money to be transferred out of the country. I got your contact from a\\rcommercial attached to your emabassy. This assurance gave me courage to link you up for\\rthis particular transaction, and I hope it will be of mutual benefit to all of us. Our contact in\\rthe Federal Ministry of Finance have given us a go a head advice to begin the process of the\\rremittance, hence we have set in motion the machinery for the take off of the transaction and\\rfurther action will commence immediately we hear from you. We have agreed that after the\\rtransfer of the money into your account, you shall be entitled to 30% of the total amount\\rtransferred, 10% for incidental expenses from you and us, while the remaining 60% will be\\rfor us. We decided to give you this percentage in order to motivate you and also to let you\\rfeel satisfied at the end of this transaction. The nature of your business is not particularly\\rrelevant for the success of this transaction. All we require is your willingness to co-operate\\rand assurance that our own share will be given to us when this money is transferred into your\\raccount. All necessary precautions have been taken to ensure a no risk situation on the sides\\rof both parties and it is believed that the conclusion of this transaction will not last more than\\rfourteen (14) working days. However, we are going to retrieve the whole documents that will\\rbe related to this transaction so that both parties will be protected after the transfer of the\\rmoney into your account. Since we have no knowledge of business, our plan is to invest this\\rmoney into Real Estate, Stocks and we can also invest in some other profitable business in\\ryour country based on your advice because many of our years has been spent as Civil\\rServant, and we may likely resign from government service to private businesses after this\\rmoney is transferred into your Account. Please note that this business is strictly confidential\\rand must not be disclosed to a third party. This is necessary to avoid disclosure that may\\rjeopardize the transaction. Finally, if this proposal is acceptable to you or if you have any\\rquestions, feel free to contact me on the above E-mail address.

REPLY STRICTLY VIA: [jelendu2@indiatimes.com]Attn: sir, Permit me to introduce myself to you, My name is Johnson Elendu., I am one of the Senior Managers in the bank I work for (Union Bank, Nigeria PLC) and I work under the Director of Foreign Exchange Operations (International Remittance). I am contacting You presently because I need your urgent assistance in a business transaction that will be of immense benefit to both of us. I have the immediate need to transfer some money that has long been declared \"UNCLAIMED\" by the chairman and some members of the board of directors of our bank. The money is the closing balance of one of our best customers ever, Late Engr. Manfred Becker, I was his personal account officer just before he died in the ADC plane crash of 1996 in Nigeria. Engr. Manfred Becker an American citizen was a contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria, he supplied and installed equipment and his company Creek land Contractors completed some of the best construction contracts in the country. His closing balance in the Bank, Union Bank of Nigeria PLC (US$40.Million) has been tagged Unclaimed because no relative of Engr. Becker has come forward to make a statement of claim. We have no knowledge of a next of kin. At this point I trust you can picture what the situation is like. We have strong proof that the chairman and the board of directors will keep most of the money for themselves and donate the remainder to a discredited military trust here in Nigeria. This invariably is an attempt to infuse more money into the acquisition of military equipment (arms and ammunition) for use in an already prostrate Africa. This of course, is senseless, hence my mission. My colleagues and my self have made several attempts at locating persons that could be remotely related to Engr. Becker and we have been doing this for about 4 years now. Right now I am almost alone in this enterprise and I have presently decided on moving the money to a foreign account. I am hereby soliciting your assistance and I will be very grateful if you will be willing to help in this regard. We have access to most of what it will take to transfer the money. The only thing we do not have is a safe account. We will provide you with answers to all the security questions, which you will have to answer to move the process towards completion. We will also provide you answers to questions that only a person related to him will know. You may however not need to make any appearance; every thing will be concluded on phone and email between you and the bank [UNION BANK NIGERIA PLC, LAGOS] for your participation you will get 30%, 5% has been earmarked for the expenses that may be incurred on both ends. 65%shall be for my colleague and I. I make this proposal in trust and in good faith, therefore, if you are interested and you agree to assist me then contact me immediately you receive this email, there is a lot more to talk about. If you are not interested, then, please, do get rid of this email and please forgive me if this message has upset you in any way. Thank you and best regards.

Until his demise, he heldsensitive positions in the military, and diplomat seat, one ofthe office he held , was the position of the personal assistantto the U.N secretary general, Koffi Annan. His death was a shockto the entire nation, the man in quote operates several foreignaccounts in our department which I mannage myself due to hisposition in the country. Such operations of accounts is called\"Private Banking\" where the deposits will only be known to theowner of the acounts and officer of the bank in charge.Normally,65% of the total deposit is supposed to be turned intothe Federal Government account and 30%, 5% given to the familyand bank respectively.  This is what the banking law and policyof my country states, When this is achieved i.e transfer of theFederal Government account part, the people at the corridors ofpower withdraw these funds, under the disguise of security issuesbut make use of theseFunds for their personal and family use.This is a case of injustice on the officer in charge of theaccount and the family of the deceased. So I released the code ofthe account partly totaling just 50% of the initial deposit.Since the code of the account is in between me and the deceasedthe fear of being checked is ruled out but I cannot makewithdrawals from this account myself and that is where you comein.All you need to do for this transaction is to follow theprocedure binding this contract together and I guarantee youit&#8217;s risk free.

There is an account opened in this bank in 1983 and since 1991 nobody has operated on this account again but all this came to light after an internal auditing that I conducted by going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out\\xa0immediately it would be forfeited for no reason.The owner of this account is MR SMITH B. ANDREAS, a foreigner, and a miner at Kruger gold co, a geologist by profession and he died since 1990. No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to ! me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is (US$26M) TWENTY SIX MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS.I\\xa0 am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in US Dollars and the former owner of the account was MR SMITH B. ANDREAS. We will sign an agreement, but\\xa0I assure you that it is real and a genuine business. Please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take immediately. Send also your private telephone number and a fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face or sign a binding agreement\\xa0together so that\\xa0we can receive this money into a foreign account or any account of our choice where the fund will be safe. And I will fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and other investments. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreign account and\\xa0 a foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.\\xa0I have a correct information of this account, which I will give to you later, if you are able and willing to handle such an amount of money in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come again in my life. I need a trustworthy person in this business because I don’t want to make a mistake, I need your strong assurance and trust. With my position now in the\\xa0office I can transfer this money to any foreign reliable account, which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending my physical arrival in your country for sharing. I will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place.You can also come to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and two of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account. I will use my position and influence to effect the legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange departments. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 30% of the total amount 60% will be for me, and meanwhile 10% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring.

When my superiors in authority concluded the negotiation for the purchases, I was told to prepare a “contract” for the purchases of the Helicopters, which I did as the Permanent Secretary of Defence and Accounting Officer. It will amaze you to hear that after the Belarusian suppliers delivered the three MI-24 Helicopters to Uganda, inspection was carried out and it was discovered that the three MI-24 helicopters were junks. Further investigation revealed that Lt. Gen. Salim Saleh who is a younger brother to the President and his Aide-de-Camp (Mr. Ruyondo) connived with the Russian company to supply helicopter that are almost out of service (junks) and they were not overhauled for selfish financial gains.\\r\\rWhen Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde probed the case, a report was released stating that The Chief of Logistics and Engineering, The Minister of State for Defence and myself have been exonerated and cleared from the offence. Please, check: (http://allafrica.com/stories/200212120154.html). Nevertheless, I lost my job and was prohibited from participating in public services.\\r\\rPLEASE NOTE: In my long years of service to my country, I was able to acquire valuable fixed assets and substantial amount of money. Why the probing of the case was going on, I was advised by my Lawyer to sell off all my acquired properties that worth million of American dollars and also to withdraw my money from my bank account to save them from being frozen and confiscated. Due to the necessity for to lie low, I delegated power to my closest aide Mr. Mike Obodoh to be in charge of my projects.\\r\\rThe money realized from the sales of my properties was added to the money that was withdrawn from my account and the total amount was US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Since I could not lodge this fund into any bank account for fear of being traced, the money was packaged and deposited with a Security Company that belong to a Holland national, based in South Africa for safekeeping. The funds are security coded and well packaged in a sealed luggage to prevent them from knowing the content. Arrangement is going on for the money to be moved from its current location to an affiliate security company in Europe by Mr. Mike Obodoh who is currently in The Netherlands to transact this business with you since I want my identity to be kept out of the money.\\r\\rWhat I want from you at this moment is to indicate your interest and willingness to receive this money for investment purposes in your country. You are going to work hand-in-hand with Mr. Mugelbe Jones whom I have authorised to send this proposal to you in The Netherlands. As soon as you receive this email, you are advised to contact him on his email address: (miobod@hotmail.com.) .He will let you know the modalities to claim the funds and also give you his phone number when you contact him. You will assist me in the investment of this money, but I will not want my identity revealed. I will also want to buy properties and stocks in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments with your assistance. At this point, I want to emphasise the high level of confidentiality, which this business demands and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence that I repose on you.\\r\\rAs soon as I receive your response, we will discuss other modalities including remuneration for your services. You can also reach me on my email address: drben211@yahoo.co.uk\\rAs you already know, time is of great essence in this transaction, kindly confirm your telephone and fax number to Mr. Mike Obodoh. Bear in mind that this project can be concluded within five days if you are prompt in your response.\\r\\rKind personal regards,\\rDR. BEN MBOYE.',\n",

On the 6th of June 1998 an American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with us and his present balance is valued at US$28,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) in my Bank. We sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally, we discovered from his employers that he died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, we found out from his account file that he never made a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless, as he had none. We therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents in the bank files. This sum of $28,500,000.00 is still lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest is being rolled over at the end of every year. As it is now, no one will ever come forward to claim this money. According to the Nigeria law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if unclaimed. Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers. This is simple; all we need is some of your details so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which would put you in place as Mr. Myers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services of an accredited Attorney for the drafting and notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letters of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. The money would be shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you. There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as a manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via email. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for us. I shall still require your assistance to invest my own share in your country just incase you can help, otherwise we'll take our share . Awaiting your urgent reply, Mr.Philip Jones. \",\n",

On the 30th of june,our company made a very big financial breakthrough when we made contact with ALHAJI DAN MUSA. We began to supply him his cow vaccine named LIM KXT COW VACCINE.

Precisely, he buys U\\rS$5,000 per carton. He asked if our organisation can source for a cheaper supplier.\\r\\rWe did market research and discovered that we can buy these vaccine in Europe for US$2,000 per carton. We moved a proposal to WICDEL GROUP COMPANY, to supply him at US$4,800 per carton which they accepted. As these supplies progressed and our company is\\rdoing fine,I requested to my boss for an increase in our salary.he was so upset that he sacked me without benefits and ten years of dedicated workmanship.\\r\\rI was so desperate that I went to the WICDEL GROUP COMPANY farms and infomed ALHAJI DAN MUSA that I have a foriegn contact that will be willing to supply him this same products at US$4,400.

HOWEVER,I INFORMED ALHAJI DAN MUSA THAT HE WILL HAVE TO PAY CASH IN ADVANCE BEFORE MY FORIEGN CONTACT WILL SUPPLY TO HIM. For the moment he has stopped all contact with my boss.\\r\\rPlease consider on how to handle this profitable project and kindly contact me immediately through my private e-mail: fredobi@indiatimes.com\\r\\rfor more details and negotiations as regards my commission.However,I will insist that my commission will be 20% of the total profit.\\r\\rNote : We will buy one thousand carton at US$2,000,000.

It is pertinent that a business of this magnitude should have commenced properly with a formal meeting of you and us to enable us know ourselves, have a fore knowledge of the nature of the business, discuss and acquaint ourselves with the responsibilities and functions of parties concerned, and appropriate shares accordingly. However, for time factor, confidentiality and personality of people involved here in Nigeria, we choose this approach for the remittance of this Fourty Five Million U.S. Dollars (US$45M). Please bear with us for making the initial contact through e-mail. But my partners are insisting for a meeting in order not to fall into a wrong hand again. I am Dr Ali Mohammed,we are members of the special committee for Budget and Planning of the Ministry Petroleum. This committee is principally concerned with contract appraisal and the approval of the contracts in order of priorities as regards capital projects of the past military government of Nigeria.With our positions, we have successfully secured for ourselves this sum of Fourty Five Million U.S. Dollars (US$45M). This amount was accumulated through undeclared windfall sales of crude oil during the gulf war.Hence together with two of our top officials at the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), we plan to transfer this amount of money into a secure overseas account by awarding a sort of contract from the NNPC. To this effect I have been given the mandate by my colleagues to contact you and ask for your assistance. What we need from you is to provide a nice account in which the funds will be transferred. My colleagues and I have agreed to compensate you or the owner of the account used for this transaction with 30% of the total amount remitted. We shall have 65% and the remaining 5% reserved for taxes and other miscellaneous expenses in your country. It may interest you to know that last two years a similar transaction was carried out with one Mr. Patrice Miller, the President of Craine International Trading Corporation at number 135 East 57th Street, 28th Floor, New York, NY 10022 with telephone number (212) 308-7788 and telex number 6731689. After the agreement between both partners in which he was to take 20% of the money while the remaining 80% for us.

In the course of carrying out our assigned duties, we discovered the sum of USD40.5 (forty million, five hundred thousand dollars) only lying idle in a suspense account with our apex bank. This funds emanated from grossly over-invoiced contracts awarded to conglomerate of foreign firms by the Petroleum Ministry on behalf of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. On completion of our assignment, this amount was deliberately not included in our report because we want to capitalize on this once in a lifetime opportunity to benefit and make a fortune out of it. The only option we have to achieve our aims and objective is to have this fund transferred to a count\\r ry of our choice where it can be kept in trust and safe custody for us. We are however handicapped at the moment by our status as civil servants, which barred us from operating foreign accounts while still in government service.\\r\\rThus, through some discreet inquiries from our Chambers of Commerce, you and your organization were revealed as being quite astute in private entrepreneurship. On this premise, we have no doubt in your ability to handle a business of this nature, which informed our desire and wish to enter into a partnership with you. This business involves the remittance of this amount into your bank account with the hope of travelling down to meet you physically in order to receive our share. We hope to invest some in profitable ventures in your country based on your advise while the balance will be repatriated home as foreign earnings. We have mapped out strategies and all paperwork is in place to ensure a 100% success.\\r\\rThe nature of your business at present does not really matter because in the world over, bigger firms do bid for big contracts especially in third world countries like ours and can subcontract part of it to other firms for execution. That is you or your firm will be regarded as one of those that executed one of such projects and therefore entitled to receive the over-invoiced amount of the contract value since the original contractor has been paid. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free as there is actually no risk is involved either now or in the future for we are well connected in official circle. Given our level of commitment at the moment, we want to assure you that with full dedication on your part, the objective of having this fund remitted would have been realized within a period of two weeks. It is hereby expressly agreed in principle that at the end of the transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire sum, 75% will be for m\\r y colleagues and I.\\r\\rIf you are interested in this proposal, please call or send me an e-mail VIA:bodegeorge@phantomemail.com for more clarifications. If however you are not interested, still let me know to enable me search for someone else to carry out this business with.\\r\\rI anticipate a timely response from you.\\r\\rThanks.\\r\\rYours Sincerely,\\r\\rCHIEF(DR.)BODE GEORGE\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r',\n",

Now he has a substantial amount deposited in a bank in Nigeria (US$ 25.M.) and he is very scared that this account will be discovered because similar accounts in Switzerland and England were previously discovered and frozen by the governments of those countries in collaboration with the Government of Nigeria.Precisely, my client's family returned US$ 1B. to the government of Nigeria in 2002 under the direction of the Swiss banking authorities, this is a confirmable matter, even as the existence of the fund mentioned above is confirmable. Now it is his intention to migrate with his family out of Nigeria towards the Middle East and he depends so much on this fund, thus he islooking for a reliable and trustworthy person who will receive the moneydiscreetly and then transfer the money at a latter date to a neutral account to be established in Lebanon when he finally succeeds with his emigration plan.If you accept my proposition and agree to participate in this transaction, you will in no case whatsoever undertake risk- expend money or execute any unreasonable task- whereas you will be well remunerated, in principle you will receive 10% of the amount transferred to you once the transaction is completed.Apart from this there is another sum of Money, held up in a Security Company (In Cash), the Money was earmarked for the support of the cause of Charity in India, but it was never retrieved before the demise of my clients father, now my client also wants to retrieve this money in addition to the money with the bank in Nigeria. The money with the Security Company is Thirty one Million American Dollars in one hundred dollar bills.Since I do not know in what vein you will take this missive I have kept the information peripheral, I will be posited to give further information upon your acceptance and will also introduce you to my client eventually.  I hope I will be able to work with you earnestly unto our joint success.I await your response eagerly.Respectfully.Abu Kyari esquire.Welcome to Sudan pioneer ISPhttp://www.sudanet.net\",\n",

Your information were given\\rto me by a member of the South African Export\\rPromotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the \\rBlack Economic Empowerment Commission (Government)\\rdelegation on a trip to the United States during a\\rbilateral conference talk to encourage foreign\\rinvestors. I have decided to seek a confidential \\rco-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder\\rfor the benefit of all parties, and hope you will keep\\rit confidential because of the nature of this\\rbusiness. \\r\\rWithin the Department of Mining Resources where I work\\ras the Director of Project Implementation, with\\rco-operation of two other top officials, we have in\\rour possession, an overdue payment in US funds. \\r\\rThe said funds represent certain percentage of the\\rcontract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a\\rforeign contracting firm, which we the officials\\rover-invoiced to the amount of US$26,400,000.00 \\r(Twenty Six Million Four Hundred Thousand United\\rStates Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has\\rbeen paid to the original contractor, leaving the\\rexcess balance unclaimed. \\r\\rThe Government of the Republic of South Africa believe\\rthat private investment in general, and foreign direct\\rinvestment in particular, are the real engines for\\rsustainable economic development, for which reason it\\rhas continued to encouraged investment in the key\\rgrowth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere\\rdetermination to pay foreign contractors all debts\\rowed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close\\rrelationship, and mutually beneficial co-operation\\rwith foreign governments and non-governmental\\rfinancial agencies. As a result we included our \\rbills for approvals with the co-operation of some\\rofficials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve\\rBank of South Africa (RBSA). \\r\\rWe are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary\\rof the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to\\roperate foreign account. The changing of beneficiary's\\rinformation/ details and other forms of documentation\\rupon application for claim to reflect the contract \\rmoney and its approvals will be secured on behalf of\\ryour company or your self. \\r\\rI have the authority of my colleagues involved to\\rpropose that, should you be willing to assist us in\\rthis transaction your share as compensation will be\\r20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and\\rthe balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all\\rexpenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so\\rincurred. \\r\\rIt does not matter whether or not your company does\\rcontract projects of the nature described here. The\\rassumption is that your company won the major contract\\rand subcontracted it to other companies. More often\\rthan not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated\\r\\rfields win major contracts, and subcontract to more\\rspecialized firms for execution. \\r\\rThis business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat\\rit with utmost confidentiality. Also your\\rspecialization is not a hindrance to the successful\\rexecution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. \\rI have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you\\rwill not disappoint us.

S. Dollars ($26,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send across to you.I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $26,.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses.

Sani Abacha, former head of State of Nigeria who died on 8th June 1998 while in office. Since the death of abacha the present Government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has been formenting members of the Abachas family including family friends. All businesses and property owned by the Abachas have been confiscated by the Government and all our Bank Account in Nigeria and abroad have been frozen. A quick reference of Newsweek publication of March 13th 1999 were 88million dollars was taken from us will give you an insight of what I have gone through. After a short while I was arrested and detained in prison custody, the government came up with a trump up charge against me and honestly speaking I have been in detention since November 1999 and I\\rwas only released on Thursdays (11-07-02) by the supreme court of Nigeria who passed judgment in my favor During the reign of abacha as the president of this country, an Aluminum Smelter Company of Nigeria (Alscom) contract was revalued. The contract was for the construction of plant, at Ikuta Abasi in Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria, for production of ingots and billets required as raw material for\\r\\rAluminum and Allied Industries, Reynolds Incorporated of America, Phoenix and M&F Companies of Switzerland conducted the feasibility studies. The contract was awarded to Ferrostall AG of Germany. However, after the revaluation of the contract, Ferrostall AG collected its own share of the increment in project cost, while abacha share of fifty-eight Million u.s. Dollars (US$58,000,000:00) was kept in our native town in Kano State Nigeria. I know that abacha was planning of how to send this money abroad before his sudden death in June 8 1998.\\r\\rWe have being looking for the best means to send this money abroad.\\rLuckily for me Nigeria was made a center for the distribution of relief marterial to the people of victims of civil war in Africa by the common wealth organization. So I made some contact  with a Common wealth officer here , and secretly deposited the money with APEX FINANCE AND SECURITIES GROUP here in Nigeria . This US$58M was secretly packaged in a trunk box, Hence all plane is to ship this money abroad through a diplomatic means with out the knowledge of anybody outside. I declared that my foreign business partners owned them. This was to bit the security system in Nigeria from knowing my involvement in this money presently, I am handicapped as what next to do since I am not conversant with international monitory policies. Hence I am contacting you as a reputable and trust worthy person, with a well experience and able hand to help.\\r\\rBecause I want you to claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the consignment belongs to my foreign business partners. Actually I got your contact from a reliable source, and also I believe you are in a good position to assist me to transfer these fund to your country for good investment.\\r\\rMy contract with EURO CREDIT COMMISSION remains few weeks to expire and I am down broke to renew the duration with the Security\\rCompany.\\r\\rAs a matter of urgency, I will like you to send to me immediately your telephone and fax number. I shall send you all the clearance documents by fax. I will then forward your name as the beneficiary and my foreign business partner to the Security Company.\\rYou will be entitled to 20% of the total sum involved for your assistance Your URGENT response is needed.

We shall base this transaction on mutual respect and honesty. Hence,it is neccessary for you to assure us of your ability  to prosecute this transaction of  great magnitude,your ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction of great magnitude involving a pending business transaction requiring maximum confidence.We are top officials of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel who are interested in importation of goods into our country with funds which are presently trapped in Nigeria.  In order to commence this business we solicit your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said trapped funds.The source of this fund is as follows:  During the past Military Regimes here in Nigeria, the government officials set up companies and awarded themselves contract which were grossly over-invoiced in various Ministries.  As a result the Government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo deemed it neccessary to set up a Contract Review Panel to investigate and recommend accordingly. After a thorough investigation, we discovered a lot of  inflated contract funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria.. We (members) have unanimously agreed to transfer part of these funds to a foreign account  However, by virtue of our position as civil servants and members of this Panel, we cannot acquire this money in our names.

It is against this background that my family and Iaugustim who are\\rcurrently staying in Amsterdam decided to transfer my father's money to a\\rforeign account. Since the Dutch law prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to\\ropen any account or be involved in any financial transaction. As\\rThe eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking\\ra genuine foreign account where the money could be transferred. I am faced\\rwith the dilemma of investing this amount of money in Holland for the fear\\rof going through the same experience in future since both countries have\\rsimilar history. Moreover, The Netherlands foreign exchange policy does not\\rallow such investment from asylum seekers. I humbly solicit for your\\rassistance in the following:\\r1) Pay a short working day visit to Amsterdam the Netherlands so that we see\\rface to face, Have a table talk that would create confidence in me that the\\rfunds will be safe in your hands and have an agreement from an advocate,\\rwhich will be duly and legally sign in his chambers before taken any step in\\rthis transaction.\\r2) Get the entire necessary document regarding this transaction and claim\\rthe boxes from the security company, open an account in your name with a\\rlocal bank here and deposit the money for onward transfer to your designated\\raccount in overseas.\\r3) Make a good arrangement for investment and do invest the money for me, I\\ram willing to give you some percentage for your assistance on this, and I\\roffer you 15%. 5% for any expenses, including your telephone calls and any\\rother expenses that may arise during this process. 80% would be invested and\\ryou get your wages monthly for managing the funds. Contact me on the above\\rEmail, provide me with your telephone and fax number so we can discuss\\rfurther and a chance for you to ask me any question you may have in mind,\\rwhile you maintain the absolute secrecy required in the transaction.\\rPlease kindly get back to me with your detail contacts.\\rSincere Regards,\\rMichael Stevens Junior.\\r\",\n",

Upon maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  Additional inquiries revealed that he died of an automobile accident without making any WILL.  There was no next of kin or relations to be traced.\\r\\rThe above stated amount is still sitting in our bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5[five] years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\\r\\rAccordingly, I will like you to stand in as the next of kin so that the fruits of our customers labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple? Would you be kind enough to do it for us?  The management of our bank is well in support of this email.  There are relatively no risks to you.\\r\\rThe money will be paid into your account.  You shall return to us 60% and keep 40% to yourself.\\r\\rIf you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.\\r\\rIt is important that you keep this matter private but treat it as urgent requiring your full consideration.

FEW WEEKS BEFORE  THE LATE  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER,  I WAS  INSTRUCTED BY HIM TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE SUM OF  US$22MILLION WHICH WAS TO BE TRANSFERRED ABROAD AND  LODGED WITH A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SAFEKEEPING  DISCLOSED AS FAMILY VALUABLES IN MY NAME PENDING  FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. TWO WEEKS LATER ON MAY 16  1997,  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO GAVE UP POWER TO THE  REBELS  LED BY LAURENT KABILA, WHO WERE ADVANCING FROM  KISINGANI AND FLED TO TOGO FROM WHERE HE LATER MOVED  TO MOROCCO WHERE HE DIED ON SEPTEMBER 7, 1997 LESS  THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER.  HE  WAS AGED 66 YEARS. I MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO NIGERIA WITH  MY SON PATRICE, AGED 17 WHERE I AM PRESENTLY  RESIDING AS A  WAR REFUGEE SHORTLY AFTER THE CAPITAL CITY   KINSHASHA WAS OVER RUN OVER BY REBELS. I LOST MY  WIFE  AND MY TWO CHILDREN, AND ALL MY POSSESSIONS DURING  THE  REBEL ONSLAUGHT ON THE CAPITAL CITY.   THE LATE MOBUTU SESE-SEKO DURING HIS 30 YEAR RULE  AMASSED A PERSONAL FORTUNE OF US$8BILLION WITH  HOUSES  IN SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. HOWEVER, THE INCUMBENT  PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE  SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO  FREEZE ALL HIS ASSETS AND CONFISCATE HIS PROPERTIES.  I  THUS DECIDED TO LIE LOW IN AFRICA TO STUDY THE  SITUATION, UNTIL WHEN THINGS GET BETTER LIKE NOW  THAT  PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA IS DEAD AND HIS SON JOSEPH  KABILA HAS TAKEN OVER.   I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY  ABROAD  WHERE THE MONEY IS STILL LODGED AS FAMILY VALUABLES.  THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM  KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO  INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST ME BY  RECEIVING THE MONEY ON MY BEHALF. ACKNOWLEDGE THIS  MESSAGE SO THAT I CAN GIVE YOU THE MODALITIES FOR  THE  CLAIM OF THE FUNDS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASIZE  THE  HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH THIS BUSINESS  DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND  CONFIDENCE WHCH I HAVE REPOSED IN YOU.   IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST, I SHALL PUT YOU IN THE  PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE  CURRENTLY BEIGN MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER  MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES.  I  AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE OF  THE  MONEY AS SOON AS THE TRANSACTION IS CONCLUDED.   FOR THIS REASON, KINDLY FURNISH ME YOUR CONTACT  INFORMATION, WHICH IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND  FAX  NUMBERS FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE  RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL USING THE ABOVE EMAIL ADDRESS.   YOURS SINCERELY,   DIAKA TSHOMBE.      ____________________________________________________________Charle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329',\n",

I am the first daughter of the most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country.\\r\\r I got your contact through network online hence i decided to write you. Before the death of my father, he took me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$30 Million (thirty million United States dollars), in one of the  security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company.\\r\\rThis amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe,  introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims. it is against this background that I and my family fled\\r\\rZimbabwe to South Africa for fear of our lives.\\r\\rAfter which, I traveled to the Netherlands and I am currently staying in the Netherlands where i am seeking political asylum and more so have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. Since the law of Europe prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of European Union. As the eldest child of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got.\\r\\rThe South African government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of my family name for fear of going through difficulty in future. Both countries have similar political history. I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make arrangements with the security company to clear the Consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as i have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa.\\r\\rBut before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment. I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction.\\r\\rIf you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in any of the country of your choice.  while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction.\\rI await your immediate reply and God bless.\\r\\rBest regards,\\rHellen Shaka Zuma\\r\\rNOTE:\\rON YOUR INABILITY TO HANDLE THIS TRANSACTION RESPOND TO ME AND INFORM ME SO I CAN LOOK FOR SOMEONE ELSE.\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\",\n",

I am 65years old; I am now a new Christian convert,suffering from long time cancer of the breast. From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live more than six months, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very Severe stage. My late husband was killed during the Gulf war, and during the period of our marriage we had a son who was also killed in a cold blood during the Gulf war. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death,I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for more than six months and I am so scared about this.  So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the development of evangelism in Africa,which is in my place,America Europe and Asian Countries.This mission, which will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently relocate to Nigeria, Africa where I live presently.  I selected you and your church after visiting the website for this Purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to donate the sum of $2,200,000.00 Million US Dollars to your Church/Ministry for the development of evangelism and also as aids for the less privileged around you. Please note that, this fund is lying in a Security Company in Europe and the company has branches,therefore my lawyer will file an immediate application for the transfer of the money in the name of your ministry. Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use,than enhancement of evangelism.  Lastly, I want you/your ministry to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without Jesus Christ in one's life is vanity upon vanity.If you have to die says The Lord, keep fit and I will give you the whole of my life. May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you. I awaits your urgent reply. YOURS IN CHRIST, SISTER MARY ABASS IDRIS.

       " {'content': 'PROJECT INTEREST.My dear friend, I am DR. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old manÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

       " {'content': 'HOW ARE YOU TODAY?FROM MR FRED KUMA.REPUBLIC OF BENIN.WEST AFRICA.TEL:229 08 69 05.Dear Friend,I am MR FRED KUMA, the director in charge of auditing and accountingsection of Continental Trust Bank cotonou republic of benin in west Africawith due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a businesstransaction that will be very beneficial to both of  us at the end of thetransaction .During our investigation and auditing in this bank,my department cameacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died ina plane crash on the 26th December 1998 on airline transafrikInternational with aircraft Lockheed L-100-30 at location Vila Nova,Angolawith registration number S9-CAO and since his untimely death the funds hasbeen dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund inour custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to thisdevelopment.Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself andpartners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable andsuccessful during the time of execution. The said amount was US$24.1M(Twenty Four million One Hundred Thousand united states dollars).As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive informationthrough my a friends who works with the Ministry of Information here inCotonou-Benin. It is him who recommended your person to me to be viable andcapable to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem.Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as thebonafide next of kin to the deceased,get the required approval and transferthis money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives andneeded information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate yourinterest and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to thisgreat business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position inthis country as a civil servant,we  are not allowed to operate a foreignaccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the timeof transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why itwill require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the nextof kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will needthe money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after dueverification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bankwhere the whole money will be remitted from to your own designated bankaccount.May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as Ihave made arrangements for a successful arrangement as an insider of thebank before contacting you.  On smooth conclusion of this transaction, youwill be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% willbe set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time oftransfer and also telephone bills, while 60% will be for me and my partners.Please, you have been adviced to keep this a top secret as we are still inservice and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal withyou.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until youconfirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your countryfor subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previouslyindicated and further investment, either in your country or any country youadvice us to invest in.All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance tochampion this transaction with me.I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible on my personal mobilephone 229 08 69 05 stating your wish in this deal.Yours faithfully,DR FRED KUMATEL:229 08 69 05.ALTERNATIVE EMAIL:efftee2002@eudoramail.com----------------------------------------------------------------Ce service de mailing vous est offert par http://www.freesurf.fr.FreeSurf, votre acces ADSL a partir de 29 euros/moishttp://www.freesurf.fr/adsl/',\n",

Thepurpose of this letter is to seek your most neededassistance in a business venture. Due to the land andpolitical problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of PresidentRobert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform whollyaffecting the rich white farmers and the few rich blackfarmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, myfather for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe.Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our businessforeign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares inmajor companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA to depositthe sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundredthousand US dollars), in a private security company. Thismoney was deposited with this Private Security company forsafety and security reasons, and was to be used for thepurchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishmentof new farms in Europe. President Mugabe's support for the violentZimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to themurder of my beloved father and other innocent lives.I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance frommy father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, butwhen the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murderattempts, I fled Zimbabwe. I am currently staying in theHolland where I am seeking political asylum. In fact mydecision to come here to seek asylum, is because the securitycompany from South Africa, has a branch holland and theyhave moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg down here.I need to transfer this money to an account and invest partof the money. Since the law of Netherland prohibits a refugee(asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involvedin any financial transaction, this is why I am seeking agenuine and reliable partner, whose account this money canbe transferred, hence this proposal to you.You have tounderstand that this decision taken by me entrusts my futureand in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money.If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, isto assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from thesecurity company from their office in Netherlands,as it has now been transfered from Johannesburg, South Africato their branch here.

       " {'content': \"Please help.Thomas Sesay KarimuThomas Sesay KarimuKarimusesay@BigMailBox.netDear sir,This letter may come to you as a surprise because we have not met. The decision to write you is out of a sincere desire to establish a business/mutual relationship with you. I got your contact through the international trade and commerce chamber (ITCC) in Madrid.My name is Thomas Sesay Karimu, the son of John Karimu (former secretery of state for mining and industry) who was killed and mutilated by the military junta led by Major Paul Koroma after over-throwing the elected government of President Tijan Kabba. Though, I don't know to what extent you are familiar with events and disturbances in Sierra-Leone but it had consistent features in the BBC, CNN news bulletins. The pressure of war drove my family out of Sierra-Leone into exile in Spain where we have been living under political asylum for three years.Sadly, my mother died of cancer 4 months ago and was buried in Madrid. Prior to her death, she gave me a certificate of a secret deposit that my father made in a security company in Europe (destination will be disclosed later for security reasons) The money $45,000,000.00 (forty-five million dollars) was deposited as family treasure. He did this with a view to converting it to his personal use at the end of the war but was killed as a result of his opposition to the rebel forces when the conflict intensified. I have however  contacted the security company to confirm the deposit and establish ownership.Due to the death of my mother and the continued hostility in Sierra-Leone, I have decided to solicit the assistance of an honest and trustworthy person or company that will assist in investing the money. I cannot do it alone due to my present political status and total ignorance of the business world. You will be given a negotiable percentage of the money at the end of the transaction.If you are honest, trustworthy and interested in the above proposal, contact me immediately through my email address for more details. You must maintain absolute confidentiality in order to ensure success. Please, indicate your personal telephone/fax numbers when replying.Best Regards,Thomas Sesay Karimu.  \",\n",

This isnecessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependableand trustworthy foreign partner. This request may seemstrange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgenceand pray that you take my request very serious.I amMr. Joseph Rodney Chesson, the first son of Late J. J.F. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to1980). On April 22, 1980, my father along with 12other Liberian Government officials was assassinatedas a result of a military coup that toppled thegovernment of President William R. Tolbert, Jr. Mayhis soul rest in Eternal Peace. Since then, my familyhas always been seen as a symbol of peace in Liberia.You can view our family web page below; (http://www.chessonfamily.com/chessonfamilypage.htm)but please do not call me on the tel/fax number below as the number is presumedbugged by the government.I received information from a reliable source thatdescribed your country as being economically conducivefor investment and her people as transparent andtrustworthy to engaging business, which made me towrite you. As you may want to know and to make youless curious, I got your email address from anInternet site that portrayed you in good light. Early this year, Liberia rebels agitated for theremoval ofPresident Charles Taylor, who portrayed a very goodexample of a bad leader. The President who neededsupport from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sumof twenty-eight million United States Dollars (US$28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as compensationfor my late father and solicited for my support. Iquickly made an arrangement with a courier companyhere in Monrovia and moved the consignment to an assetmanagement company in the uk. I did not supportPresident Charles Taylor because my conscience is notfor sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up inLiberia, he placed all the eligible members of myfamily under travel watch,confiscated all ourtraveling documents and frozen all our account inLiberia. Later in July, foreign troops invaded Liberiaand different peace keeping meetings were held andPresident Taylor was advised to step down for nationalpeace. On the 11th August 2003 President CharlesTaylor flied into exile but the problem we are havingnow is that he handed over power to his Vice-PresidentMoses Blah who is more wicked and dangerous. He wasthe person that instigated Taylor to confiscated allour traveling documents and frozen all our account inLiberia. That is why I requested for your sincereassistance pending when a fresh election will be heldhere. The main rebel faction Liberians United forReconciliation and Democracy (LURD) has vowed tocontinue its war if Taylor hands over to Blah. Therebels are not happy with the above development sothey still continued fighting. WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO FOR US:I will transfer theownership of the consignment /boxes containing thecash to you and issue you a power of attorney throughmy Lawyer. With these document you will lay claims tothe money as my proxy from the company in europe.The entire operation is risk free since it is only youand me and my Lawyer that knows the details of themoney after you must have taken the money to yourcountry where it is save my lawyer will then meet youin your country to use my share of the money forinvestment. Bearing in mind that your assistance isneeded to transfer this fund, I propose a commissionof 20% (twenty percent) of the total sum to you forthe expected services and assistance. Your private faxand telephone numbers are needed to enhance the speedyconclusion of this transaction (our only hope in lifenow) urgently. Your urgent response via the aboveemail address is highly needed so as to stop furthercontact. I must use this opportunity to implore you toexercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matterextra ordinarily confidential whatever your decisionwhile I await your prompt response. Our phone lineboth home and abroad are bugged. So don�t call me. Iwill always call you at my convenient time and in aconducive atmosphere.

The major reason is that the fund was deposited in a Security Company in Europe it was because of the ways the president was ruling the country,that he foresee things might go wrong with him in due course. Right now, the rebels are at war with the !\\r president and the\\rAmerica government has asked the president to step down.

       " {'content': 'CAN I TRUST YOU ??????............Hello,\\rMay l briefly introduce myself to you. I am hajia Maryam Abacha, the\\rwife of the late Nigerian Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June,1998.\\rEver since the death of my husband, my family has been facing a lot of\\rproblems mostly with the present Civilian Government.\\r Consequently, my son -Mohammed Abacha who has been under torture in detention for a sin he did not commit and made to make a lot of\\rconfessions as regards valuables, money inclusive that my late husband\\rentrusted in his hand for safe-keeping has been released and presently being under security watch.\\rThe latest is his confession on the US$700,000,000.00 (Seven Hundred\\rMillion United States Dollars) cash his late father gave him for safe keeping.\\r Please checK Newswatch Magazine of May 8th/15th, 2000 issue on Website:http://www.newswatchngr.com] to confirm the above story.\\rAlso the recent publication by THISDAY Newspaper on Thursday\\rMarch 1st Edition, which London Court clear ways for more recovering of\\rAbacha´s family looted money.\\rPlease confirm this issue on website:\\rhttp://www.thisdayonline.com, click the Archive/2001/March\\r2001/Thursday March 1st.\\r On these note, I  deposited a total sum of US$30,000,000.00 (Thirty\\rMillion United States Dollars) sometimes march 2000 with a Security company  abroad (name with held for now). Normally, we (I and Mohammed Abacha) usually do such transaction, by first sending the money out by Cargo to a security company outside Nigeria through\\rDiplomatic means, as African Arts. And thereafter go to the security\\rcompany for claim before transferring it to any bank of our choice.\\rPresently, l can not travel out of Nigeria, because,if you have gone\\rthrough the above\\rmentioned website address, you will see how My son´s confession have\\rimplicated my husband and infact the whole of my family.

You can view my profile at my website www.gov.za/profiles/shabangu.htmAfter the swearing in ceremony making me the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy, my husband Mr Ndelebe Shabangu died while he was on an official trip to Trinidad and Tobago in 2002. After his death, I discovered that he had some funds in a dollar account which mounted to the sum of US$15.5M with SYNTHEX TRUST SECURITY AND PRIVATE COMPANY.This fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced contract which he executed with the Government of South Africa. Though I assisted him in getting this contract but I never knew that it was over-invoiced by him. I am afraid that the government of South Africa might start to investigate on contracts awarded from 1998 to date. If they discover this money in his bank account, they will confiscate it and seize his assets here in South Africa and this will definetely affect my political career in government. I want your assistance in clearing this money from SYNTHEX TRUST SECURITY AND PRIVATE COMPANY.As soon as the fund is cleared, you are expected to move it immediately into another personal bank account in your country. I will see to it that the account is not traced from South Africa. As soon as you have  confirmed the fund into your account, I will send my eldest son with my Attorney to come to your country to discuss on business investments.For your assistance, I am offering you 4 Million (Four million United States Dollars Only) However, you have to assure me and also be ready to go into agreement with me that you will not elope with my fund.

I got your contact through the help of my sister-inlaw that works with the Canadian Chambers of Commerce and Tourrism,due,I did not disclose to her my humble intention for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children. Having noted the confidence reposed on your person by\\rthe sponsor of the recommendation, I became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of US$20 Million secretly willed in my favour by the late general (my husband).\\r This money was kept in a Security Company in Amsterdam Holland and I have all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a Security Vault for safe keeping.This money has been defaced for Security reasons and also to avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons.We have been deliberating on\\rhow to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for non-speculative investments in your country.However,the current civilian administration of retired General Olusegun Obasanjo(The President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) is\\rseeking vengeance on the Abacha family because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office. In pursuit of this vendetta,the present Government have resolved to freeze all known assets of General Sani Abacha including properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband\\rin Switzerland,UK and Australia. In fact, the attack on our family (The Abacha's) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling passport,family accounts and even trying some members of our family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband..My first sonMohammed Abacha who was arristed and incacerated for the past 3years wasjust reliese from prison on the agreement to refund $1.5 Billion to the\\rFederal Government of Nigeria allegedly stollen by my late Husband.We arenot ready to comply to this as most of the family assets and bank accountsabroad have been Freezen by the Obasanjo regime.\\r\\rIn view of this grevious threat to our Economic and personal survival,our family trustee have secretly protected the will,The Security Company has called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the demurrage it is incurring and I told them we would come and claim it verysoon but they seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas amount, hence the reason why I have chosen you and hope that you will come\\rto my full assistance and unlimitedco-operation.In the meantime,there is a travelling embargo on us(the whole\\rfamily members) and our local accounts are seized. We are currently living on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the sins of my late husband. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my children from a hopeless future. And if you agree to help, we will compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25% of the total amount of $20 Million US Dollars.In that case, when the money ($20 Million) is moved into yourdiscrete account, you will be allowed to withdraw 25% inyour favour,while 10% has been set aside for any expenses you might incur (There are demurrage to pay before the fund is sign and claimed by you.)during the process of securing this fund.\\rThe remaining 65% will be invested meaningfully for my children's future. My cousin (DR.UCHE EDWARD) has perfected arrangements with the Trust Company concerned and has been assured 100% risk free and safe operation.What I demand from you now is to arrange to visit the Finance Company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide\\rowner.\\r\\rAnd in due course, all contacts must be made through\\rDR.UCHE EDWARD through his Telephone: 234-80-330-78104.\\rE-mail address: ucheedward10@yahoo.com\\r\\rI look forward to your quick response while thanking\\ryou for your co-operation.

I am the chairman of the Economic Recovery Committe(ERC) set up by the present civilian Government ofNigeria to review economic policies of governmentparastatals, and find out ways to reduce waste andmaximise revenues allocated to them.In the course of our work at the ERC, we discoveredthis fund which resulted from gross re-valuation ofcontracts  by top government officials of the federalministry of Aviation (FMA). The company thatexecuted the contracts have been duly paid and thecontracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$19.2Million lying unclaimed in the escrow account of theCentral Bank of Nigeria.Upon interogation of the directors of engineering andfinance, who both happens to be my contemporaries inthe university, they confessed to me in confidencethat they had an agreement with the originalcontractor to re-value the original contract by 30%.This 30% which amounts to USD19.2m was to be their share from the contract, since the original contractor was well disposed towards giving them the conventional 10% kickback. When I now asked them what they intended to do now that my committee has discovered this USD19.2M. They begged me not to disclose this information to the government as they will likely lose their jobs and their family names destroyed. I was at at a crossroad, as I did not want my friends to suffer for what other top government officials do and get away with. I discussed with the other two members of my committee and we all unanimously agreed to transfer this fund out and share amongst ourselves.I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust bymy colleagues in the committee to look for an overseaspartner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$19.2Mlegally sub-contracting the entitlement to you/yourcompany. This is bearing in mind that our  civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign company or running  foreign account while in government service hence the need for a foreign partner.Should this transaction interest you, you are tocontact me on my personal e-mail address, so that Ican brief you fully, and discuss your renumeration forthis undertaking. All logistics are in place and all modalities workedout for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement afterreceipt of the following information:  Your  fullname/ company name, address, company's details &activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applicationsand lodge claims to the concerned ministries &agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinentto state here that this transaction is entirely  basedon trust as the solar bank draft or certified chequedrawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeriacorrespondent bankers in America, Asia and Europe isgoing to be made out in your name.Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter  using my personal E-mail address.Yours Faithfully Abayomi Davies.\",\n",

       " {'content': 'PROJECT INTEREST.My dear friend, I am DR. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Roger  Scott made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Roger  Scott died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Roger  Scott did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger  Scott that the fruits of this old man&#8217;s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look forward to hearing from you soonest.Thanks and regards.DR.

You can view my profile at my website: www.gov.za/profiles/shabangu.htmTHE PROPOSALAfter the swearing in ceremony making me the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy, my husband Mr Ndelebe Shabangu died while he was on an official trip to Trinidad and Tobago in 1996.After his death, I discovered that he had some funds in a dollar account which amounted to the sum of US$30.5M with a South African bank which had her offshore House in the CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIAThis fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced contract which he executed with the Government of South Africa. Though I assisted him in getting this contract but I never knew that it was over-invoiced by him. I am afraid that the government of South Africa might start to investigate on contracts awarded from 1990 to date.If they discover this money in his bank account, they will confiscate it and seize his assets here in South Africa and this will definetely affect my political career in Government.I want your assistance in opening an account with CENTRAL BANK through my Attorney so that this fund could be wired into your account directly without any hitch. As soon as the fund gets to your account, you are expected to move it immediately into another personal bank account in your country.

As soon as you have confirmed the fund into your account, I will send my eldest son with my Attorney to come to your country to discuss on business investments.SHARING PERCENTAGEFor your assistance, I am offering you 20% of the principal sum which amounts to US$6,100.000.00 (Six million One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) However, you have to assure me and also be ready to go into agreement with me that you will not elope with my fund.If you agree to my terms, kindly as a matter of urgency send me an email.

Rodney Chesson Chesson Family Corporation,Liberia.Email: jrchesson@rediffmail.comKindest attention,I am very sorry for the informal manner in which this mail is reaching you. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trustworthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you take my request very serious.I am Mr. J. Rodney Chesson, the first son of Late J. J. F. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to 1980). On April 22, 1980, my father along with 12 other Liberian Government officials was assassinated as a result of a military coup that toppled the government of President WilliamR. Tolbert, Jr. May his soul rest in Eternal Peace. Since then, my family has always been seen as a symbol of peace in Liberia. I received information from a reliable source that described your country as being economically conducive for investment and her people as transparent and trustworthy to engaging business, which made me to write you. As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your email address from an Internet site that portrayed you in good light.Early this year, Liberia rebels agitated for the removal of President Charles Taylor, who portrayed a very good example of a bad leader. The President who needed support from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sum of twenty-eight million United States Dollars (US$ 28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as compensation for my late father and solicited for my support. I quickly made an arrangement with a courier company here in Monrovia and moved the consignment to an asset management company in Europe. I did not support President Charles Taylor because my conscience is not for sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up in Liberia, he placed all the eligible members of my family under travel watch confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. Later in July, foreign troops invaded Liberia and different peace keeping meetings were held and President Taylor was advised to step down for national peace. On the 11th August 2003 President Charles Taylor flied into exile and handed over power to his Vice-President Moses Blah who is even more wicked and dangerous. He was the person that instigated Taylor to confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. On Tuesday 14th October 2003, Gyude Bryant took office in Liberia as the head of an interim government. Bryant, 54 was by picked b! y the warring factions and this step has offered Liberia a new chance to end nearly 14 years of violence. My lawyer approached him as regards releasing our traveling documents and the embargo on our bank accounts but he declined and told us that his priority is disarm fighters and pave the way for elections that is why I requested for your sincere assistance pending when a fresh election will be held here. WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO FOR US: I will transfer the ownership of the consignment /boxes containing the cash to you and issue you a power of attorney through my Lawyer. With these document you will claims to the money as my proxy from the asset management company in Europe. The entire operation is risk free since it is only you and me and my Lawyer that knows the details of the money after you must have taken the money to your country where it is save my lawyer will then meet you in your country to use my share of the money for investment. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, I propose a commission of 20% (twenty percent) of the total sum to you for the expected services and assistance.Your private fax and telephone numbers are needed to enhance the speedy conclusion of this transaction (our only hope in life now) urgently. Your urgent response via the above email address is highly needed so as to stop further contact. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily confidential whatever your decision while I await your prompt response. Our phone line both home and abroad are bugged. So don't call me. I will always call you at my convenient time and in a conducive atmosphere.Best regards,J. Rodney Chesson.N.B.

       " {'content': \"DEAR FRIENDDear Friend.\\r\\rI am Mr. Phil Ipenza, Provincial Manager Development Bank of Southern Africa(DBSA). I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a foreign mining consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$12,5 00,000.00 (Twelve Million,Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr. Richard Moss died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss did not declare any kin or r!\\r elations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$12,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Moss so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for processing and notarizat!\\r ion of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and lett!\\r er of pr\\robate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: Ipenza@themai!\\r l.com\\r\\rThanks and regards.\\r\\rMr. Phill Ipenza.\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\",\n",

I shall however provide you with directives on what to do as we proceed.Contact me on my private telephone numbers above or through my email address with information about your full contact addresses including personal telephone & fax numbers and Bank information immediately if you are interested. As soon as I get this information and I am convinced that you a!\\r re capable to do this transaction,I will consult a probate lawyer on your behalf as the beneficiary for the drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the neccesary documents and letter of Probate/Administration in your favour so as to put you in better position as the beneficiary .Please you have to be eraborate in your profile to enable me make a good assessment about your desirability.I shall tell you the name of my bank soon after I am convinced of your personality.\\r\\rI also need strong assurances from you to the effect that you can guarantee the safety of the money when it gets to your account.However,I want you to understand that as a man of strong character it beats my conscience that I have to do this deal for two strong reasons.Firstly ,to curtail the excesses of the directors and secondly to plan ahead of my retirement which is just few months from now.In view of this,you may be approached after the transfer to provide me with investment advice as I plan to invest the fund in any lucrative venture after retirement.\\r\\rAt the conclusion of this business, I shall travel to your country for sharing.I have mapped out 30% of the total amount for you for assisting me,5% to take care of all expenses from both party and the remaining for me.\\r\\rI await information about you and look forward for prompt reply from you.\\r\\rWarmest Regards.\\r\\rDr.Don Ike\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\",\n",

       " {'content': \"Introduction.Dear friend, I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons Joseph and Basher out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Cote d'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over (Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated. I have deposited the sum Fourteen Million United State Dollars (US$14,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate your interest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Joseph) who has the out modalities for the claim of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed. I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as advise by your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands, and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Joseph) shall divulge to you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address. Yours sincerely, Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko. ____________________________________________________________Charle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329\",\n",

Now that God has called me, Ihave willed and given most of my properties and assetsto my immediate and extended family members and aswell as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul andso, I have decided to give alms to charityorganizations, as I want this to be one of the lastgood deeds I do on earth.

       " {'content': 'PROJECT INTEREST.My dear friend, I am Mr. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Roger Scott made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Roger Scott made died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Roger Scott made did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger Scott  so that the fruits of this old man&#8217;s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look forward to hearing from you soonest.Thanks and regards.Mr. Yetunde BasseyNOTE: Get back to me ONLY any of these email addresses: yet_basey@indiatimes.com, ybassey@ecplaza.net, ____________________________________________________________Charle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329',\n",

       " {'content': 'KINDLY ASSISTDear Friend, After deliberation with my children, I decided to contact you for your assistance  in standing as a beneficiary to the sum of US$15.5M(Fifteen Million,Five  hundred Thousand United States Dollars ). Firstly, let me start by introducing myself as MRS SUSAN SHABANGU, a mother  of three children and the former Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy under the auspices of the President of South Africa MR THABO MBEKI. You can view my profile at my website www.gov.za/profiles/shabangu.htm THE PROPOSAL After the swearing in ceremony making me the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy, my husband Mr Ndelebe Shabangu died while he was  on an official trip to Trinidad and Tobago . After his death, I discovered that he had some funds in dollar, US$15.5 million United States Dollars currently in a coded security company vault in Europe which I now intend to use to establish a profitable business for my children toenable my children and I start life again.As a result, I am urgently in need of a very reliable investor participant who is not known as my associate,that I could entrust with the pin and certificate of deposit to help me remove the box including Gold and Diamond Platinium since no one name were used in securing the vault. I can not successfully claim it myself as the government searchlight is still on me.Though, I do not know you in person but I still maintain my late husbands theory that business is people and contacts. hence I crave your assistance,you will also Bank and assist me in investing this money with my lawyers approval on project. Finally,more details on the logistics and modalities of the trasaction will  be given to you as soon as I receive your acceptance letter. Do not forget the confidenciality sorounding this transaction, while awaiting for your letter I am calling on the Almighty God to be with all of us . This fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced contract which he executed with the Government of South Africa. Though I assisted him in gettingthis contract but I never knew that it was over-invoiced by him. I am afraid  that the government of South Africa might start to investigate on contracts awarded from 1990 to date. If they discover that he has this kind of money,  they will confiscate it and seize his assets here in South Africa and this  will definetely affect my status. The money is contained in a strong steel security box in cash and it is presenting deposited with a security firm in Armsterdam- Holland where it is registered as family treasures and valuables for security reasons.In side the box are all documentation for funds. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO FOR ME .1.You are to come to Armsterdam ,open a non-resident account in one of the commercial banks where funds will be deposited before finally being transferred to your nominated account overseas(as may be mutually agreed).2.I have made arrangements to give the transaction the legal cover as overseas  investment.3. Security storage and demurrage charges have accumulated considerably since my husband death. I am making arrangement to raise money to settle this.It is imoportant that you and my Attoney are together throughout the transaction in Armsterdam, Holland.4.I would appreciate at the end of the day ,if part of the money is invested  in developing countries like South Africa. 5.We will need to sign a legally   binding agreement relating our benefits and commitments in this transaction  For your assistance, I am offering you 20% of this fund,Please honesty is the watch word in this transaction .However, you have to assure me and also be ready to go into agreement with me that you will not elope with my fund.

I contacted you to assist in repartrating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Bank where this huge deposits were lodged. Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an account valued at about US$35.5M. (thirty-five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United Stated Dollars) has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated. Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over three years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you are from the same country so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$35.5M. can be paid to you and then we can share the money between us. 60% to me and 30% to you,while 10% should be for expenses and tax as your government may require. I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through.

The present Government ofGeneral Olusegun Obasanjo is currently in a face off with myfamily in his bid to recover all our money because my Husband isdead.They have brought up charges of corrupt enrichmemnt against us.Unfortunately, he is currently facing same from the NationalAssembly right now. I pray he does not get an Impeachment Thelaw they made is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly tofrustrate, humiliate, dismember and widen the scope of hatred formy family. A personal vendetta by President Obasanjo who wasjailed by my husband\\'s Government for plotting a coup d \\'etatagainst his administration in 1995.This highly calculated attempt by this administration plus someWestern Banks through bi-lateral relationship has taken away fromus a whopping amount in Switzerland and Bank accounts around theWorld. This rampaging of our Bank accounts abroad have yielded tothe barbaric pressure and just few months ago we were squizedout of another US$395m because the accounts bear our names. Thisassertions can be ascertained independently if you wish toconfirm this from a leading newspaper in Nigeria (This Day Newspapers) fromtheir website at www.thisdayonline.com from the archives section in theMarch 10,2001, January 26,2002 and March 18, 2002 editions.This pressure is taking a great toll on my family and all we everowe. You may be aware that my surviving eldest son (Mohammed),was undully detained without trial untill thursday 11TH of July2002 one year now that the Supreme Court of Nigeria Ordered hisrelease and cleared him of any wrong doing as he has beenlanguishing in prison for the past three and half years. It was on Monday23RD September last year that he was finally released to us.Please we wish to solicit your cooperation as a foreigner to helpus receive some family property / (Money) Deposited with aSecurity company which is our only hope / source of livelihoodfor now. This is a call for you to help receive this money andput the money into good investments since we are barred fromleaving the Country for now.According to my estimation in Western Europe and America alone westill have over US$70M in cash with Security Companies that weintend to put in your care by getting a trusted foreigner tohandle money for the purpose of investment and safekeeping abroad.Please Note that you will be expected to deal directly with thesecurity company with the information and LEGAL POWER we shallgive you to handle the entire transaction. There is demurrageaccrued over time payable to Security Company to enablecollection of the Consignment, since the Deposit we made at thetime of Deposit has since expired. You must also know that CONSIGNMENT WASDEPOSITED AS FAMILY TREASURES, ACTUAL CONTENT ON CONSIGNMENT WAS NOT DECLAREDTO SECURITY COMPANY AT THE TIME OF DEPOSIT TO SAFE GUARD IT. If you cando this, contact my ATTORNEY, BARRISTER ALI KOLOMA Fax; 234-1-7591936 asyou will be well REWARDED. This is however subject to our negotiation andagreement.You can contact me ONLY via our family Attorney, Barrister AliKoloma, BY email: palmgroovechambers@winningteam.com for security reason and further details.Endeavor to keep this highly confidential.

I apologize for using this medium to reach\\ryou for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is\\rdue to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.\\rBe informed that your enviable credentials/particulars were\\rgiven to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion\\rCouncil who was at the Government delegation to your country\\rduring a trade exhibition. I have decided to seek a confidential\\rco-operation with you in the execution of the deal described\\rhereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep\\rit as confidential because of the nature of this transaction .\\rI have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for\\ryou. On Dec. 19, 1998, a Canadian Oil consultant/contractor with\\rthe Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Mr. Antoine Blanc\\rmade a numbered timed(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,\\rvalued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million Dollars)in my\\rbranch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his\\rforwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a\\rreminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,\\rthe Ministry of Energy and Natural resources that Mr. Antoine\\rBlanc died from a plane crash. On further\\rinvestigation, I found out that he died without making a Will,\\rand all attempts to trace his next of kin was futile. I\\rtherefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.\\rAntoine Blanc did not declare any kin or relations in all his\\rofficial documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my\\rsecurity company. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my security company\\rand the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at\\rthe end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.\\rAccording to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years,\\rthe money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian\\rGovernment if nobody applies to claim the fund.\\rConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an\\rForeigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Antoine Blanc so\\rthat the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the\\rhands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I\\rwill like you to provide immediately your full names and address\\rso that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and\\raffidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We\\rshall employ the services of one Attorney for drafting and\\rnotarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents\\rand letter of probate/administration in your favor for the\\rtransfer. A bank account either newly created or existing in any\\rpart of the world which you will provide, will then facilitate\\rthe transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of\\rkin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in\\rthe ratio of 75% for me and 20% for you. Then 5% will be used to\\roffset any expenses incurred during the entire processing.\\rPlease your percentage is not negotiable. it is considerate\\renough. There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this\\rtransaction will be done by the Attorney, and my position as the\\rBranch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this\\rtransaction.\\r\\rIf you are interested, please reply immediately via the private\\remail address below.

The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$180,000,000.00 (One hundred and Eighty Million United States Dollars). But in the course of negotiation, the contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of US$149,500,000.00 (One hundred and Forty-nine Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to our advantage unknown to the contractor. This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian firm is presently securing payment from my Ministry, where our Board is in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval.As a civil servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by law to operate an account outside the shores of Zambia.

We are top government officials drawn from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing FMW&H, the Presidency and the Federal Ministry of Finance FMF making up the Contract Review Panel CRP set up by the present administration to review all contracts awarded by the past government.In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered grossly over-invoiced contracts which were awarded to foreign contractors. The contract have been duly executed and commissioned but leaving the contract commission US$12.4M Dollars floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN ready for payment.The funds resulted from connivance between our predecessors and the foreign contractors. The contractors have been duly paid their contractual entitlement US$81M Dollars but leaving the over-invoiced funds US$12.4M Dollars in CBN's escrow account. We are therefore seeking your assistance in the transfer of these funds out of this country by providing your company name and address to be registered as a subsidiary or afilliate of the real company that executed the contract so as to effect the ballance of the funds into your account as part of the executor.This is necessary as we cannot use the help of a local contractor here since the job was executed by a foreign company.

This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black Farmers and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father \" Mudada Abba \" was one of the victims. It is against this backround that, I and my Mother and three   younger ones fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and I currently staying in the Netherlands in a village called Zwolle, where my family are seeking political asylum and more so I have decided to transfer my father\\'s money to a more reliable foreign account. As the eldest daughter of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future, both countries have similar political history. As the Eldest daughter, I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as I have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa.But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into Partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 10%of the money while the remaining 90% will be for my investment in your country. Should you which to assist me, please furnish me with your telephone and fax number me with the above via e-mail while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction.

This is a story that has to be imagined than to express because of the ugly memory and cost.\\r\\rSince the demise of my father, we the entire family has been grieving and honestly, very hard for us to trust people especially here in Africa. I had only confided in few close friends as we were in need of securing the wealth of my father. It was within these meditation that I got your contact through a reliable source. Honestly I have not reveal this to anyone.\\r\\rBased on this, I decided to write you first because this is my family last hope of living comfortably as we do when my father was alive. Before my father passed away, he had already acquired a vast estate and a considerable wealth in Sierra Leone.  In our neighboring country, my father deposited two boxes containing cash of thirty-three Million Dollars (US$33,000,000.00) in a security company. When he deposited this boxes, my father purposely registered it as a precious item in order not to attract the attention of the security company officers, and also for safety reasons until he is ready to use it for investments.\\r\\rUnfortunately, as an adage says, Man propose but God disposes my father could not live to achieve all his dreams. In his declaration, he use my name as the next of kin. As the war broke out, we shifted to Johannesburg, South Africa for the safety of our dear lives. Right now, I am writing you from Johannesburg, looking for a way to remove the money out of the security company with a reliable person overseas for a proper investment. We cannot establish any businesses here in Africa due to instability of Government in most countries. Base on this, I am seriously soliciting on your kind assistance to aid me on how to invest this money with you in your good country. When my beloved country was in war, I was still a student and I had a little or no knowledge about business, this is one of the reason I need your help most.

I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On September 6, 1997, a Canadian Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Jerry Sheldon made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Jerry Sheldon died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Jerry Sheldon did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one has ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Jerry Sheldon so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guaranttees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Awaiting your urgent reply via my email.Thanks and regards.Mr.Kalada HartConfidiential Email Address you should respond to: kaladah@yahoo.com \",\n",

I need you to receive my financial entitlements from my financiers overseas on my behalf for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS and hope you would not let me down.\\r\\r\\r\\rIt might interest you to know that in my supporting role to the Minister of Public Works here in Pretoria, South Africa it is my responsibility to handle some very intrinsic matters for, on behalf or with the Minister. By my duties, it is almost impossible for any file/Contract Proposals to get to the Minister for approval, without it passing through my scrutiny.\\r\\r\\r\\rBy my religious status and as the South African Deputy Minister of Public Works, I have cause to help a lot of foreign contractor-companies (mainly American) to secure the release of their entitlements from the coffers of the government of South Africa. I did this, principally, as a help to the concerned companies, but in appreciation of my efforts, most of them committed themselves to paying some handsome monetary honorarium to me. However, because of my position as a political appointee, it is impossible for me to collect such money immediately or even directly. Hence, I need you to collect this money on my behalf and use it as you would be further directed for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS. Of course your effort will not be in vain. You would be well rewarded for your help in this regards.\\r\\r\\r\\rAll the money from the various companies put together is totaling amount to Eight Hundred and Fifty Five Thousand United States Dollars (US$855,000) only. The snag is that I just discovered that I couldn\\'t collect this money, directly, from these companies in my name or the name of any of my family members, because government will investigate \"why?\" and \"what for? Therefore, to forestall any such problems, I decided to contact you through this secured and private medium, to solicit your assistance in this regard.\\r\\r\\r\\rYou will receive this money on my behalf, and use it as you would be further directed. That way, there will be no link between the companies and me. I will instruct the concerned companies to make the money available to you on installment either via swift means or by cheque as you so desire of not more than $75,000, as the case may be.\\r\\r\\r\\r>From the money you receive on my behalf, you would be entitled to retaining 10% of the sum while you would be required to wire the balance 90% for its purpose of humanitarian services as would be advised. For example, if you receive $75,000, you would be required to retain 10% ($7,500) while you wire the balance $67,500 for its purpose. This is basically on trust. It is a simple job you do for me and all expenses for the cost of transfer of funds would be from the 90% and you will not spend a single cent from your money to actualize this project. No financial commitment from you and it\\'s simple and risk free. You receive the money on my behalf, take away your 10% and redirect the remaining 90% as would be instructed. I can assure you that if you keep to our agreement, this will be the beginning of a mutually beneficial relationship between the two of us. Afterward, there are a lot of other things we can do together that will fetch you a fortune.\\r\\r\\r\\rIf you are interested and would like to work with me for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS, I would need you to provide me with the following:\\r\\r\\r\\r(1) IF YOU DESIRE TO HAVE THE PAYMENT BY SWIFT MEANS:\\r\\rProvide me with:\\r\\ra). Name of your bank.\\r\\rb) Address of your bank.\\r\\rc) Bank Telephone and Fax.\\r\\rd) Account Number.\\r\\re) Swift Code/Routing Number.\\r\\rd)Account Names.\\r\\r\\r\\r(2).OTHERWISE, IF YOU DESIRE TO HAVE THE PAYMENT BY CHECK:\\r\\r\\r\\rThen, you do not have to provide your banking information. Simply provide me with:\\r\\ra) Your full names (As would be on the check).\\r\\rb) Contact/Mailing address\\r\\rc) Your Telephone and Fax Number.\\r\\r\\r\\rFurthermore, as surety for the money that would be paid to you on my behalf, I would need a scanned copy of your International Passport or Drivers License for record purpose.\\r\\r\\r\\rWhen I receive all the aforementioned, I will then send a working AGREEMENT between you and I, to guide and guard this relationship.\\r\\r\\r\\rOnce all these are sorted out, I will notify the first company of my desire to receive my money through you and instruct them accordingly.\\r\\r\\r\\rIn conclusion:\\r\\r\\r\\rI wish to draw your attention to the wise observation of Marlene Gill, who wrote:\\r\\r\\r\\r\"To exist is to change,\\r\\rTo change is to mature,\\r\\rTo mature is to go on creating one\\'s self endlessly,\"\\r\\r\\r\\rAs we continue to change and to mature as individuals and as a nation, let us continue to dream that one-day, very soon, Cholera and HIV/AIDS will no longer devastate our nation, that all of our young people will resort to responsible behavior and that the moral values of our forebears will once more dominate our society.\\r\\r\\r\\rLET US DARE TO DREAM.

After a month, we sent areminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporationthat Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident with his family along Benin/Shagamu Express Way.

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence as you read this letter.  Though this might come to you as a surprise since we have not met or spoken with each other before.  I plead for your understanding and tender my humble apologies if I had taken you unaware.\\r\\rMy name is KEN AMOBI, a member of the committee set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to supervise the activities of the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF), the agency that manages proceeds from the sale of crude oil in my country.  At the inception of the new democratic government in my country, the Petroleum Trust Fund was ordered to wind up its operation to enable the new committee take over.  The former Chairman of the agency in the person of Major General Muhammed Buhari (Rtd.) was also retired.\\r\\rIn its place a new committee in which I am a member was appointed to take over and oversee the activities of the agency. The duty of the committee amongst others includes verifying all outstanding contract claims and debts with the sole objective of settling such long overdue claims.  I therefore decided to contact you directly having gotten your name and company's information from a business handbook of your country I discovered in the former chairman’s official study, which he left behind in his office.\\r\\rGoing through some of the files left behind by the former chairman, we discovered that he has secured out of the Central Bank of Nigeria a forex release to the tune of US$25,500,000.00 for the payment of goods and services supplied by foreign contractors for the execution of KUBUWA WATER PROJECT in the oil rich Niger Delta.  He was trying to transfer the funds to a ghost company abroad when he was removed from office.  In confidence, we know that the goods and services were not supplied but used his office to approve the payment in favour of a foreign firm with no fixed address.  He confided in me as a member of the new committee that he used his position to over invoice the contract.  After his removal from office, this over invoiced amount is floating in the system and left unclaimed.  He has therefore requested me to help look for a foreign company into whose account the funds will be transferred.\\r\\rI am now soliciting for your cooperation to enable us process the transfer of the funds to your account. You should provide us your company's name or any other name as long as you will be able to receive the amount.  It will be treated as one of the outstanding payments due to you on executed contract.  We will take measure to duly register your company here in Nigeria to give it legitimacy.  We need your company's name and account particulars to enable us file application for foreign exchange allocation order at the Federal Ministry of Finance.  The moment we accomplish this, we will raise Contract Award Certificate in your company's name to show that a contract was actually awarded and executed by you. The nature of your business does not matter.\\r\\rFor your participation and investing in this project, we are prepared to concede 25%of the total sum to you.  On completion of the project, we will commit a substantial percentage of our share into investments in your country and we will direct you on how to repatriate the balance of our share.\\r\\rI wish to state here again that confidentiality should be our watchword. If the above proposal meets your approval, please respond immediately.\\r\\rEndeavour to furnish me with your secured private telephone and fax line for easy reach.\\r\\r\\rKEN AMOBI\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\",\n",

During the course of our auditing we discovered the sum of (USD$9.7m) floating in an account opened in this Bank since 1999 and as from 2001 nobody has operated on this account again, and after going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of the account died without a [HEIRE]sept 11th 2001 by plane crash, hence the money is floating.After due verification I noticed that no other person knows about this account except his wife who was also invovled in the crash, and the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that until his death he was the Director GOLD ARK [SARL] Since our Bank Arab Bank Plc Benin rep. got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come forward and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and policies but up to date nobody came up to this bank as his next of kin or relative. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming forth and we don\\'t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up as his relation. And the country law here does not allow such money to stay more than Five years, for the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this period.Upon the receipt of your response, I will send to you the application form, bank\\'s contact and the next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased.

I am married to Usman Isa Kaitha of blessed memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in Madrid Spain for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child he died after a brief illness that lasted only four days. Before his death he was a very devoted Muslim and I was a devoted Christian by birth battling with both cancer and fibroid problems. When my late husband was alive, he deposited the sum of $25.5million dollars (twenty five million, five hundred dollars), which he inherited from his late father (sheikh Usman Isa Kaitha) with an overseas finance and security firm. Presently, this money is still with finance and security firm. Recently, my doctor told me that I had a terminating illness (cancer) that would last for the next four months. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a Christian organization or a devoted Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in.  I want this Christian organization or individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund churches, orphanages, widows and also propagating the word of God and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the holy bible. The holy bible emphasized so much on the giving of alms, charity and this has encouraged me in taking this bold step. I took this decision because I don't have any child and my late husband's relatives are all Muslims and I don't want my husband&#8217;s hard earned money to be misused by people that call me an unbeliever.I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner hence the reasons for taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with God the highest and the most merciful one. I don't need any telephone communications but will only give you the contact of my lawyer because he is the one who is going to assist you in making you the beneficiary of the consignment in the finance and security firm if you receive this letter and accept to assist me to conclude this transaction, if you want to speak with me he will arrange for that because my doctor warned me not to talk for too long a time and secondly, I can't discuss in the presence ofmy husbands relatives for they always stay with me in the hospital, my lawyer is the only person that knows the decision that I am taking.With God, I know that all things are possible and as soon as I receive your reply through my lawyer I will now give him instruction to make you the beneficiary of the consignment and all necessary steps to take before receiving these funds and I shall also give you the contact of thefinance and security firm I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original beneficiary of the funds. I want you and the Christian community where you reside to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted Christian though married to a Muslim, whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth and in spirit, please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in souring for another Christianorganization or a devoted Christian for the same purpose. Until I hear from you my dreams will rest squarely on your shoulders, may the Almighty God continue to guide and protect you. Amen.

Alternative Email:judeigbo@juno.com\\t\\t  Sir,  Compliment of the day and how is life general with you? Of course it is my humble wish to solicit and crave your indulgence to make this project request for a joint business transaction which I hope will not come to you as a surprise, hence I plead for your pardon.   I am Mike Igbo, the manager of headquarter first bank of Nig. Plc. Lagos. I have an urgent and confidential business proposal for you.   On June 6, 1997, an Australian oil consultant/contractor with via National Petroleum cooperation (NNPC) Mr. Peter Bush made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calenderer month valued at US$25,000, 000. 00(Twenty-Five Million US Dollars) in my branch.  On maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarded address but got no reply after months we send a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employee (Nigeria national petroleum Corporation) that Mr. Peter Bush died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, it was clear that he died without making a will. All attempts by the Australian to trace his next of kin were fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Peter Bush did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his deposit document in my bank. The total sum US$25,000,000.00 is still in my bank as dormant acct. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian banking law, after five years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government. If the account owner is certified death and nobody comes forward to claim it.  This is the situation, and my proposal is that I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the beneficiary/next of kin. This is simple. All you have to do is to immediately send me the details of a bank account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the proper money transfer document. The money will then be transferred into the account for us to share in the ration of 60% for me 30% for you while the remaining 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred with here and there.  There is no risk involved. I am using my position and connection in the bank here to do all the document work for the transaction. We shall employ the services of an attorney to draft the will and obtain all necessary documents and letter of administration in your favor for the transfer. This transaction is risk free guaranteed. If you are interested, please reply immediately confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction could be most profitable for both of us. Please do not expose this deal if you are not interested because if you do, it will take me out of seat.  I am awaiting your urgent reply.

Be informed that this money is not connectedwith drugs; money laundry,firearms and looting which I believe will put fears in youto render the required assistance needed from you and consequentlywithdrawing your help forsecurity reasons.Hence the source of this said money is clean and clear.This money was deposited in my personalin name, andthere is no way it can be transferred telegraphically underthe bankingprocedures which could have been the easiest, but becauseof monetarytransfer restriction by the Federal Government of Nigeria,that isdefeated. Rather I have arranged a diplomat manager to movethis money out in cash to anydestination where it will be easy for you to collect underdiplomaticimmunity.This he has assured me of. As a soon as I see your responseandwillingness to help as regards to this, I will furnish youon the next line ofacti onto take, but be rest assured that this transactionis 100% risk free,and my husband will not raise any alarm because he will notlike to puthimself, his job and office in jeopardy, and if he does, hestands thechange of loosing his job.As soon as this money is moved to you, and you confirm tomethat you have received it, I will be coming to meet you upthere in your country where I wish to live the rest of my life. Iwill be offering you 25% of this money for all your help at this time ofneed, while somepercentages has been  set aside for my Brother tocomplement his efforts here. Beinformed that this transaction will not last more than 14working daysand it will be concluded because every arrangement has beenput in place.Your negative or positive response will be highlyappreciated.Yours faithfully,Mrs. Rose Obaseki ___________________________________________ Look Good, Feel Good www.healthiest.co.za',\n",

There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral WILL attatched to the account. Since his death , I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of his company.The total amount involved is 106,000,000.00 USD.[ One hundred and six million United States Dollar ]. We wish to start the first transfer with $6,000,000.00[Six million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.I have secretly discussed this matter with the general manager of the bank who I must involve in order to have a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate. On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providinghis/her bank account where the fund will be transferred for immediate investment on any viable project as no one has come up to be the next of kin.The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of domancy. In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her personal account.At the conclussion of thetransfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfercan be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased.

I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of mybank who perished with his entire family (His wife and only son) in a plane crash (Korean Air Line801) on August 6, 1997.Since the demise of this customer of ours , the bankmanagement of COMMERCIAL BANK OF AFRICA has made valuableefforts to get in touch with any of the late customer'sNext-of-Kin or relative anywhere in the world but unfortunately, all our efforts did not yield any positiveresults as no one has come to claim his funds to the tuneof Twenty one million, five hundred thousand united statesdollars(USD21.5m) which has been with my bank all thesewhile.Recently, the Federal Government of Nigeria directed thatall funds not claimed (which has exceeded the stipulatedbanking period of seven years for such money) should beconfiscated to the Federal Government Treasury Becausethe banking ethics here does not allow such money to staymore than seven years.This means that this money will berecalled to the federal Government treasury as unclaimedafter this period, precisely within this first quater of this year.On this note, the chairman of the board of directors of thebank recently called me and told me in confidence and trustto source for a reliable foreigner who would stand as ourforeign customer's next of kin. We (myselfand the chairman) have reasoned that if we fail to collectthis money the Nigerian government will confisticate it andsomeone else will end up looting it. Thats's why we havedecided to contact you, hoping you will prove tobe a reliable foreigner to stand as next of Kin to thedeceased customer to claim the total fund from his accountwith the bank so that the proceeds of his account can bepaid to you.Be assured that this transaction is risk free and we willdo all possible to give it the legal and legitimate backingit requirs so that both parties will be protected frombreach of the law both locally and internationally.Upon receipt of your response, I shall furnish you with thenext step to take on how you shall prosecute this claim toyour account. The entire transaction should be completedwithin 10 official working days fromthe day the bank receives your initial application.When you receive this letter, Kindly send me an e-mailsignifying Your acceptance or otherwise, include yourprivate Telephone numbers for more explanationand confidential communication.Waiting to hear from you soon,Best Regards,K.

I am Mr.Nze Moore from Arab Bank Plc,Benin Rep. During the course of our auditing we discovered the sum of (USD$9.7m) floating in an account opened in this Bank since 1996 and as from 1999 nobody has operated on this account again, and after going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of the account died without a [HEIRE] on oct 31 1999 by plane crash, Egyptair flight 990, (http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/egyptair990.list/)hence the money is floating. After due verification I noticed that no other person knows about this account except his wife who was also invovled in the crash, and the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that until his death he was the Director GOLD ARK [SARL] Since our Bank Arab Bank Plc Benin rep. got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come forward and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and policies but up to date nobody came up to this bank as his next of kin or relative. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming forth and we don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up as his relation. And the country law here does not allow such money to stay more than Five years, for the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this period. Upon the receipt of your response, I will send to you the application form, bank's contact and the next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased. When you receive this letter, kindly send me an e-mail signifying your decision.Including your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick communication.

       " {'content': \"BUSINESS: Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha.I am Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha, from Kuwait. I am married to Usman Isa Kaitha of blessed memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in Madrid Spain for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child he died after a brief illness that lasted only four days. Before his death he was a very devoted Muslim and I was a devoted Christian by birth battling with both cancer and fibroid problems. When my late husband was alive, he deposited the sum of $25.5million dollars (twenty five million, five hundred dollars), which he inherited from his late father (sheikh Usman Isa Kaitha) with an overseas finance and security firm. Presently, this money is still with finance and security firm. Recently, my doctor told me that I had a terminating illness (cancer) that would last for the next four months. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a Christian organization or a devoted Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in.  I want this Christian organization or individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund churches, orphanages, widows and also propagating the word of God and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the holy bible. The holy bible emphasized so much on the giving of alms, charity and this has encouraged me in taking this bold step. I took this decision because I don't have any child and my late husband's relatives are all Muslims and I don't want my husband&#8217;s hard earned money to be misused by people that call me an unbeliever.I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner hence the reasons for taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with God the highest and the most merciful one. I don't need any telephone communications but will only give you the contact of my lawyer because he is the one who is going to assist you in making you the beneficiary of the consignment in the finance and security firm if you receive this letter and accept to assist me to conclude this transaction, if you want to speak with me he will arrange for that because my doctor warned me not to talk for too long a time and secondly, I can't discuss in the presence ofmy husbands relatives for they always stay with me in the hospital, my lawyer is the only person that knows the decision that I am taking.With God, I know that all things are possible and as soon as I receive your reply through my lawyer I will now give him instruction to make you the beneficiary of the consignment and all necessary steps to take before receiving these funds and I shall also give you the contact of thefinance and security firm I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original beneficiary of the funds. I want you and the Christian community where you reside to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted Christian though married to a Muslim, whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth and in spirit, please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in souring for another Christianorganization or a devoted Christian for the same purpose. Until I hear from you my dreams will rest squarely on your shoulders, may the Almighty God continue to guide and protect you. Amen.

I should have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity. Please accept my apology. The purpose of my letter is to seek for foreign assistance with regards my late father money. My name is Laurent Nkono, the first son of\\xa0 Nkono Banjul ,one of the most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country.This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims. . It is against this background that, I and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands where we are seeking political asylum.Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US8.5 million (Eight million, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. Now the family have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of Netherlands, As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them hence I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future and as you are aware both countries have similar political history. As a businessman, I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. Due to my current status in the Netherlands My lawyers shall work on my behalf to complete this transaction with you.\\xa0If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment(funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as I have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa. But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly a concrete arrangement for the investment of part of the funds thereafter the clearance from the Security Company. I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have your percentage of the money immediately after the funds hit your account, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, it is opened for negotiation. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 15% of the money while the remaining 80% will be for my investment in your country. Please contact me as soon a possible via the above email address,\\xa0 while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction.Thanks, GOD BLESS YOU Yours Faithfully, George Nduumba. \\xa0\\xa0 Freeserve AnyTime - HALF PRICE for the first 3 months - Save £7.50 a month www.freeserve.com/anytime\",\n",

That's why I contacted you.I am Mrs. Susan Martins the wife of Mr. John Martins of Zimbabwe.During the current war against famers in Zimbabwe and from the support of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country, all the white and black farmers were ordered to surrender their farms to his party members and his followers. My husband who was one of the best farmers in our country and treasurer of the farmer's Co-operation did not support his idea and so the party members invaded my husband's farms and burnt everything in the farm, killed my husband and made away with a lot of items in my husband's farm.After the death of my husband, my children and I decided to move out of Zimbabwe because our lives were in danger with the fund that my husband kept in his hidden safe in my house. The amount contained in the safe is US$30,5 Million (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) and we decided to move this money to the Republic of South Africa, where we deposited it with a private  Security Company as a valuables in a box/consignment. This I did for security reasons and to keep from public eyes.I have two options, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for proper profitable investment of the money in your country.Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me.

Hello Sir,  I am  PRINCE OGO,a member of the Movement For Democratic Change in  Zimbabwe...my party is opposed to the Zanu-PF party of the incumbent  President Robert Mugabe.I went into a partnership with a white farmer  and a buisness man in Zimbabwe and as we progressed in buisness,i  bought  his ideas and philosophy which made me join the movement for  democratic  change which is dominated by the whites(of which my colleague is a top  member).   We control a greater portion of the white-dominated farms in Zimbabwe  and we are major shareholders in major companies in Zimbabwe.The Mugabe  government and his political associates are not tolerant with the  activities of the movement for demcratic change and he is using  indirect  guerilla war tactic to oppress the members.   Zimbabwe war veterans invaded our farm and confiscated some of our  assets and held us hostage.I managed to escape from their brutality but  my buisness partner died on the struggle.He left message that i should  sell off all our assets including the farms,estates and the companies  ensuring that his family relocates oversea and also to invest the money  propperly bearing in mined that the next step of the guerillas will be  to confiscate those remaining assets.

OWith due respect trust and humility, I write you this proposal, which I believe will be a great interest to you. I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family and I. That's why I contacted you.I am Prince Charles Zuma the first son of Late Mr.Morris Zuma who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family in a business transaction, hence I decided to write to you.Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to Deposit the sum of US$29 M (Twenty Nine Million United States Dollars). in a private security company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as Precious Metals to avoid any suspicion from the security company.This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals and establishment of a new Commercial farm in Swaziland. This land problem came up when Zimbabwe President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a New Land Act reform, which wholly affected the rich white Commercial farmers and some few Black Commercial farmers.This resulted to killings and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans in the society. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my father is a victim. It is against this background that my family and I who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's money to a foreign Country since the law of South Africa prohibits refugees to transact any business with the bank.As the eldest son of my father, I am given the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign partner who will provide a foreign account where this money could be transferred into as soon as possible for the investment of my family. I must also let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free. If you accept to assist my family and me. All I want from you is for you to make arrangements and come to Johannesburg,South Africa so that you can open a non-resident account in your name which will aid us in transferring this money into any account you will nominate overseas.I have two options, firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, or you can go into partnership with me for proper profitable investment of the money in your country.Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses that might be incured in the process of this transaction.If you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to give you 20% of the total money, while 75% will be for my family and me. If you are really capable and willing to assist me, please contact me immediately on the above telephone or by email. Finally, please treat this matter as urgent and Confidential. I intend to leave this country soonest.Thanks for your mutual co-operation. I expect your urgent response.Best Regards,PRINCE CHARLES ZUMA\",\n",

My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of my country's Contracts Review Panel (CRP) who are interested in diverting some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the Apex Bank of my country. In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated account the said floating funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of 2003. The source of the funds are as follows: During the last military regime in my country, government officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and parastatals. The present civilian government set up the Contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts.\\xa0My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds, which are presently floating in our (Apex) Central Bank, ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes.However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in my country. I have therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of U.S.$20,500,000.00\\xa0 (Twenty million, five hundred thousand U.S. dollars). That is why I am seeking your assistance. We have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows;\\xa0(i) 25% to the account owner (you). (ii) 65% for us (the panel officials). (iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us) incidental to the actualization of this project.\\xa0We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other viable business till we are ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home.

This account was open with the bank in 1993 and since 1998 nobody has operated it. After careful investigation, I discovered that the owner of this account was the president of   MIRA CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LTD. Despite several attempts by the bank to trace the relatives/next of kin of the deceased, up to date nobody has yet come forward to claim the money.I later discovered that all his supposed next of kin died with him in the auto crash incident. I have spent the last five years monitoring the account and gathering necessary information and documents on it. Now that all papers are ready, I am asking for your assistant to release the money to you as next of kin or relation to the deceased for safekeeping and subsequent sharing.  The banking laws of Nigeria stipulates that such money, if unclaimed after five years of maturity, will be transferred into the Central Bank treasury as unclaimed effect. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and presenting a Nigerian as the next of kin to a foreigner could raise concerns from the bank management. I am ready to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. 10% will be used to pay off all the necessary fees/charges involved in the transfer. 25% will go to two other officials of Eagle Bank that are with me in this and whose positions will greatly help in expediting the transfer. I will be taking 45%. Please note that these figures are negotiable. After the money has been transferred to your country, I will visit your country for the disbursement/investing of my share according to the percentages we agree upon. Note this transaction requires utmost confidentiality and I am assuring you that it is 100% risk-free so you need not be afraid. I will not contact any other person until I am convinced that you are not interested. Can you please send me your phone and fax number for safer communication when needed.

We wishto start the first transfer with $6,000,000.00[Sixmillion] and open successful transaction without anydisappointment from your side, we shall re-apply forthe transfer of the remaining balance to your account.I have secretly discussed this matter with the generalmanager of the bank who I must involve in order tohave a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund toany foreign bank account which you are going tonominate. On this note, I decided to seek for areliable foreigner who will act as the foreignbeneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providinghis/her bank account where the fund will betransferred for immediate investment on any viableproject as no one has come up to be the next of kin.The banking ethics here does not allow such money tostay more than six years without claim hence the moneywill be recalled to the government treasury asunclaimed after this long period of domancy. In viewof this I got your contact through my personal searchto see if you can assist by providing your safe bankaccount for the transfer or find a reliable person whowill be capable of receiving such amount in his or herpersonal account.At the conclussion of the transfer 65% of the fundwill be for me, I will give you 20% of the totaltransfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and inyour country while the remaining 5% will be set asideto settle expenses both parties might incure duringthe transfer process. Upon the receipt of your reply,I will send to you a detailed information about thetransaction.I will not fail to bring to your noticethat this business is 100% risk and trouble free andthat you should not entertain any fear as allmodalities for fund transfer can be finalized within 7to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as thebeneficiary of the fund from the deceased.When you receive this letter, Kindly send me an e-mailor you can call me or fax me. You should also includeyour private fax and phone numbers for easy and safecommunication.TEL:870-763-648313   :870-763-648314.FAX:870-763-648315.

Howeverstrange or surprising this contact might seem to youas we have not met personally or had any dealings inthe past, I humbly ask that you take due considerationof its importance and the immense benefit it will beto you.After careful consideration with my children, weresolved to contact you for your most neededassistance in this manner. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is notacceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as aperson of integrity.First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properlyto you. My name is Mrs. Susan Shabangu, mother ofthree and the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy of The Republic of South Africa for seven years running as you will find in the link below: http://www.gov.za/gol/gcis_profile.jsp?id=1066  I will now give you a general overview of thesituation. When I was sworn in as Deputy Minister ofMinerals and Energy in 1996, with my influence, myhusband Mr. Ndelebe Simon Shabangu a very successfulbusinessman was awarded several contracts in myministry and had direct dealings with foreigninvestors in this field. Due to my politicalstatus, I was not involved in my husbands businesswhich was very vast and successful. My beloved husbanddied whilst on an official trip to Trinidad and Tobago in February 2001.When my husband died, I was contacted as next of kinby a private security firm in Europe to come forthwith the Certificate of Deposit and claim a safetydeposit my husband has in their Vault in his name. At that time, my children and I did not have an ideawhere the Certificate might be. We then instructed thesecurity firm to continue holding the safety deposituntil further instructions from me. Whilst preparingfor the second remembrance of my beloved husband, Iwas going through his library collection and to myastonishment I discovered a Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit with this privatesecurity firm, and other documents relating to thesafety deposit in a book. The safety depositwhich is a trunk, is stocked with hard currency (USDollars) totalling $10,000,000 which was generatedfrom cash payments from his business associates in thediamond trade from Antwerp, Belgium.Though I knew my late husband was in the diamondbusiness, I did not have the knowledge that he movedfunds in cash. This has came as a shock to me and mychildren, and we have decided to have this fundinvested immediately in commercial and residentialproperties abroad as well as profitable ventures, asany member of my family cannot hold such a hugeamount in our name due to my political status, hencewe sincerely propose to you to render us your mostneeded assistance in this regard.If you agree to render us your assistance, your rolein this project will be to act on my behalf as atrustee to receive the safety deposit containing thefunds from the Security firm. Though I believe thistransaction should be based on mutuality, my family'sinterest will be protected by a family associate, whois a lawyer(attorney) attached to the SouthAfrican Embassy in the country where the security firmis located. He is now aware of the safety deposit, andI have informed him that I am locating one of myhusband's business associates (you) to handle thefunds and invest on our behalf, as he might be opposedto our decision if he found out that I barely know you.For your reliable assistance, we are offering you 20% of the funds. I thank you in advance aswe anticipate your assistance in enabling usachieve this goal. On hearing from you, I will forwardyour contact to the gentleman lawyer who will berepresenting us, and also give you hiscontact for both of you to communicate and proceedwith the transaction. He will be working with you for a mutual conclusion ofthe process and I look forward to a long lastingbusiness relationship with you. As you may understand, due to my sensitive position in thepresent government, it is not safe to communicate withme via phone or fax. This is why I have communicated with you with myprivate email address, and I like us to keep this way,for the safety of this transaction.whether or not you are interested in assisting us please let us know.This will enable us make alternative plans, in the event of non-intereston your part.With warm regards,Mrs. S. Shabangu.-- \",\n",

       " {'content': 'Re:SULE OKETAYO EAGLE BANK PLC suleoketayo@alexandria.cc  Dear Sir/Madam, I am Sule Oketayo, the head of the Treasury Department of Foreign Operations Eagle Bank PLC of Nigeria. In my department, I discovered an abandoned sum of US$13,500,000.00  (Thirteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account belonging to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in 1998 in an auto crash. This account was open with the bank in 1993 and since 1998 nobody has operated it. After careful investigation, I discovered that the owner of this account was the president of   MIRA CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LTD. Despite several attempts by the bank to trace the relatives/next of kin of the deceased, up to date nobody has yet come forward to claim the money.I later discovered that all his supposed next of kin died with him in the auto crash incident. I have spent the last five years monitoring the account and gathering necessary information and documents on it. Now that all papers are ready, I am asking for your assistant to release the money to you as next of kin or relation to the deceased for safekeeping and subsequent sharing.  The banking laws of Nigeria stipulates that such money, if unclaimed after five years of maturity, will be transferred into the Central Bank treasury as unclaimed effect. The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and presenting a Nigerian as the next of kin to a foreigner could raise concerns from the bank management. I am ready to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. 10% will be used to pay off all the necessary fees/charges involved in the transfer. 25% will go to two other officials of Eagle Bank that are with me in this and whose positions will greatly help in expediting the transfer. I will be taking 45%. Please note that these figures are negotiable. After the money has been transferred to your country, I will visit your country for the disbursement/investing of my share according to the percentages we agree upon. Note this transaction requires utmost confidentiality and I am assuring you that it is 100% risk-free so you need not be afraid. I will not contact any other person until I am convinced that you are not interested. Can you please send me your phone and fax number for safer communication when needed. Also please kindly note that all the money to finance this transfer will be provided and you will not be asked to contribute anything. When I hear from you, I will send you an online banking access code with which you can log in to verify the account and balance using the banks online banking website.Best Regards,Sule Oketayosoketayo@alexandria.cc',\n",

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence as you read this letter.  Though this might come to you as a surprise since we have not met or spoken with each other before.  I plead for your understanding and tender my humble apologies if I had taken you unaware.My name is KEN AMOBI, a member of the committee set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to supervise the activities of the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF), the agency that manages proceeds from the sale of crude oil in my country.  At the inception of the new democratic government in my country, the Petroleum Trust Fund was ordered to wind up its operation to enable the new committee to take over.  The former Chairman of the agency in the person of Major General Muhammed Buhari (Rtd.) was also relieved of his position as the chairman.In its place a new committee in which I am a member was appointed to take over and oversee the activities of the agency. The duty of the committee amongst others includes verifying all outstanding contract claims and debts with the sole objective of settling such long overdue claims.  I therefore decided to contact you directly having gotten your name and company's information from a business handbook of your country I discovered in the former chairman's official study, which he left behind in his office.Going through some of the files left behind by the former chairman, we discovered that he has secured out of the Central Bank of Nigeria a forex release to the tune of US$25,500,000.00 for the payment of goods and services supplied by foreign contractors for the execution of KUBUWA WATER PROJECT in the oil rich Niger Delta.  He was trying to transfer the funds to a ghost company abroad when he was removed from office.  In confidence, we know that the goods and services were not supplied but used his office to approve the payment in favour of a foreign firm with no fixed address.  He confided in me as a member of the new committee that he used his position to over invoice the contract.  After his removal from office, this over invoiced amount is floating in the system and left unclaimed.  He has therefore requested me to help look for a foreign company into whose account the funds will be transferred.I am now soliciting for your cooperation to enable us process the transfer of the funds to your account. You should provide us your company's name or any other name as long as you will be able to receive the amount.  It will be treated as one of the outstanding payments due to you on executed contract.  We will take measure to duly register your company here in Nigeria to give it legitimacy.  We need your company's name and account particulars to enable us file application for foreign exchange allocation order at the Federal Ministry of Finance.  The moment we accomplish this, we will raise Contract Award Certificate in your company's name to show that a contract was actually awarded and executed by you. The nature of your business does not matter.For your participation and investing in this project, we are prepared to concede 30%of the total sum to you.  On completion of the project, we will commit a substantial percentage of our share into investments in your country and we will direct you on how to repatriate the balance of our share.I wish to state here again that confidentiality should be our watchword. If the above proposal meets your approval, please respond immediately.Endeavour to furnish me with your secured private telephone and fax line for easy reach.KEN AMOBIukpd@email.cz\",\n",

With the cooperation of my\\rassistant and head of the audit committee attached to\\rthe task force, I have successfully saved about\\rUS$37.5 million.\\rThis money is as a result of allocation of excess\\rcrude oil to the foreign dealers, which has been sold\\rbut this money is not entered in the financial\\rstatement of my task force. This money was lying\\runclaimed in the account of the task force, known only\\rto me and the chief security officer in our ministry\\rwho help me in\\rmoving\\rthe fund out through his security network and me\\rinvolved in the excess\\rallocation.\\rHowever, the legislators of the new democratic\\rGovernment of my country have set up a panel to look\\rinto the past activities of some government companies\\rand parastatals. I do not want the panel to discover\\rthe money I saved.\\rI cannot lodge this money into my private bank\\raccount. In my country, public servants are not\\rpermitted to operate any account in excess of $500,000\\rUS Dollars. Now the idea is to have a foreign partner\\rwhom the sum will be transferred to. I  have concluded\\rarrangement and transfered this money to a finance\\rcompany for safekeeping to avoid the government from\\rseizing this fund .\\rAll you have to do is to give me  your private\\raddress,\\rphone and fax lines and . I will\\rsend you the details of the transfer and necessary\\rdocument as soon as you provide them.\\rIf you can assist me transfer this money into your\\rnominated bank account,I will give you 20% of the\\ramount. You will keep the remaining sum for my wife\\rpending\\rher arrival to your country. We intend to invest 50%\\rof the sum in business. With your knowledge and past\\rexperience your advice will be highly needed for the\\rinvestment. We would want to know the lucrative\\rbusiness areas in your country we can invest on with\\rthe 50% of the sum.\\rDon't worry about any problem in this business. I\\rassure it is safe and no risk is involved. No other\\rparty is aware of the sum from the excess allocation\\rexcept my partner and me. However, this transaction\\rshould be secret and confidential.\\rI awaits your reply on your participation or not, so\\rthat I can search for another willing person.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On June 8, 1999, a foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr.Richard Moss died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South Africa Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Moss so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Awaiting your urgent reply via my email:fredmende4@rediffmail.comThanks and regards.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.I got your contact from the World Trade Center (W.T.C) regional office in Lagos,Nigeria although the details of my intention was not made known to them. On June 6 1997, an American oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$11,600,000.00 (Eleven Million,Six Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Ke! lly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$11,600,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6{Six} years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man’s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple;1)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I will like you to!  provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. 2)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. 3)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin of Mr.Barry Kelly.

After careful investigation,I discovered that the owner of this account was the President of GUNN FINANCE PTY LTD, a Foreigner named Mr.John W.Clouson,a National of your country who died in 1990. The account has no beneficiary at present and investigations proved that his company does not know anything about the account. The total amount is US$75.5M (seventy Five Point Five Million United States Dollars only). In light of the above fact, I need your assistance in this rare opportunity by providing your Bank account or any account of your choice where this fund will be remitted. Your assistance as a Foreigner is necessary because the management is ready to welcome anybody, preferably a Foreigner who has the correct information of the account which I will give you immediately you express your interest and capability to conclude this transaction with me.Now that the management of the bank has ordered that all dormant accounts be frozen, On the strength of this order, I wish to take advantage of this situation and present your Names as the next of kin and get it transferred to your designated account.Be informed that all documents related to this transaction will be destroyed immediately after the transfer, since every arrangement to transfer this fund to any account you will provide has been concluded. Furthermore, on receiving your positive response, I will apply for annual leave for our face to face meeting in your country for the sharing.

Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.

I am contacting you with regard to transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that atransaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything has been taken care off, and all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.PROPOSITION;I am the account officer of a foreigner who died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by CNN.WEBSITE.http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.htmlSince his death, none of his next-of-kins has come forward to put claims for this money as his heir, because they all died in the same accidenthimself and his wife(May their soul rest in peace). Though, the bank has made several publications to locate the family members, but all was not successful. We cannot release the funds from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the funds (US$35,000,000.00) to be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin. Because after five years the money will be called back to the bank's treasury account as unclaimed bills andthe money shared amongst the directors of the bank. So it was as a result of this,we conceived the idea of searching for a foreigner who can apply as the next of kin/beneficiary. It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate division an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. Pleaseacknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following informations, if you are interested.1.A Beneficiary name? In order for me to prepare the document for transfer of the funds in your name.2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers. For our personal contact and mutual trust in each other.

I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.Within the Department of finance where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand U.

Dollars ($25,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with theassistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.This amount $25.5m represents the balance of the total revenue collections from income tax, mining lease and export duties in respect of diamond mines, expressed as a percentage of total tax revenues (net collections, National Revenue Account from this projects we have been able to secure thisreasonable amount.$25.5m as commission resulting from over invoice ,hench all the necessary approvals has been completed.This amount $25.5m represents the balance of the Estimated revenue total value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual Estimated revenue cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the Tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 20% of the $25.5 million, 70% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses.

I am aware that this is certainly an unconventional approach to starting a relationship but as time goes on you will realize the need for my action. I am Mr. Mark Zuba, a native of South Africa currently residing in Amsterdam, Netherlands for a management course, at the Hoge University.  Allow me to explain my reason and importance of my writing to you. Sir I am requesting your assistance in order to redeem an investment made with the Southern Mining Corporations Limited, in which I am a senior executive.  The said investment now valued at Ten Million United States of American Dollars (U.S.$10,000.000.00) was purchased by Eric Reilly and contracted out to the Southern Mining Corporations Limited in September 1979.  This redeemable investment interest has now matured and has been cleared for disbursement since March of 2001.    Since then, there has been an extensive global wide attempt to locate and notify any living relatives of Eric Reilly being that he himself died in December 1987.  We have confirmed through three independent search agencies that there are no living relatives in which whose favour the investment can be paid.  Being that two of my colleagues are also executives in the account department of the Mining Corporation, we have access to all Reilly's information, we can claim this money with you.  All we need to do is file this claim in your identity and effecting the necessary documentary changes, which lies in our respective departments and proclaim you as actual beneficiary of this investment.  These funds can be paid into any designated account in which you provide in any given country.  My proposal to you is that for your assistance you will withhold 30% of the total sum while, ensuring that my partners and I receive the remaining 70%.  I hope that you are able to understand the entire nature of my proposal. There is no risk involved in this transaction now or after the successful conclusion of it. As stated earlier, there are no living relatives to lay claims on these funds. Therefore this transaction is legal, however without your assistance this money will be returned over to the Southern Mining Corporations Limited as lost fund.  Please for further question, feel free to contact me through this e-mail address: markzub@mail2world.com let me know if this proposal is acceptable to you.

And since then our client has failed to come forward  to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a considerable amount of money in demurrage.Consequently, in our bide to contact this client to redeem the demurrage which his consignment had accumulated we discovered that our client was the former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same year the consignment was entrusted into our care.\\r\\rSince the death of our client President Mobutou Sese seko, none of his benefactors has come forward to claim the consignment with us, which means that non of his relatives or aids had any knowledge of this consignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to scanned the  box after some of workers have been dismissed for the day l find out that our client deposited in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the  box that were registered as treasurer by our client actually contained a considerable amount of money in United States Dollars amounting to about US$35million Dollar. Since this development I have been nursing plans secretly.\\r\\rI also found out from enquiries and the foreign media that our late client  siphoned a lot of money from his country while he was in office as head of state.It is my conviction that the consignment in our vault was part of the money that our client siphoned and now that he is dead there is no race to this money in our care. I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me in transferring this money out of South Africa to your country for immediate investment with your assistance.\\r\\rI have also decided that you will generously be entitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receipt  of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me of this transaction, I will immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the complete funds to your country, all the  documents that covers this box of consignment will be send to you  so that you as far as l concern.\\r\\ryou have nothing to worry about, as I will  be there to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper documentation.  This transaction is 100% risk free. Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this matter. Please reply to the above email address with your telephone and fax so that i can call you.\\r\\rThanks.\\rYours faithfully.\\rMR.FRANK SHABALALA.\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\",\n",

I write this letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of  US $ 20 000,000.00 with you. I inherited this funds from my mother. This funds was generated through the sale of Diamond and Timber when my father was the head of state. My mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position to engage in the business of Diamond and timber since she knows that her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the privilege situation.When my father was assassinated on 16th January 01 by one of his bodyguards Lt. Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some Top Army officers that wanted to topple his government, I escaped to Cameroon because of the fear that I might be arrested by my half brother Lt. General Joseph Kabila the present head of state. Actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of relationship because of tussle for who among them will be the first lady and this ultimately affected us their children.Considering the relationship between South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo new government, my mother advised me to leave for Cameroon for security reason, while the funds were deposited with a security Company.On getting to cameroon where I have been living since then  I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this funds out for safe banking and profitable foreighn investment. Honestly I contacted you because I don't want to invest this funds in Cameroon nor Africa due to my status in my country as a result of my fathers death..And moreover I wouldn't want to take risk because this funds is all that I and my mother is depending on because my half brother has seized all my father'sassets and funds and left I and my mother empty handed without knowing that this funds was deposited at the security company. so this is why I decided that investing this funds abroad should be the best safest typy of adventure for me. I will be honoured if I can be given the privilege of investing this fund through your help.In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distress call to save my mother and I from a hopeless future. And if you agree, I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 20% of the total fund and annual 5% of the after tax returns on investment for the first three years. Thereafter, the terms shall be varied. 5% for expenses, which may arise during this transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive,When the fund ($20,000,000.00) is moved into your discrete account, you will be allowed to draw 20% your favor, while the remaining 75% will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in your area of business and deterrents sectors of the Economy in your country which are dividends yeilding.Should you for any reason not interested,please kindly reach me so as to make other contacts and please try  to keep this letter tight secret for the interest of my family.Best regards.JOHN KABILA\",\n",

Please go through the website below to confirm this storywww.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html We could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants, we can not do it on our own or with close friends because that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time of transfer since we still work in this bank, this is the actual reason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this fund, even an empty account can also serve for this purpose.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 25% as gratification for your assisting us, while 5%will be set aside to take care of expenses on our both sides that may arise during the time of transfer and also for telephone bills, and the remaining 70% will be for me and my partners.What I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I have in my possession, all the necessary documents to successfully accomplish the operation.  Please, bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk free. Further information will be given to you as soon as I receive your positive response. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish. Best Regards.Dan Patrick.

His Next of Kin was his wife that was involved in the crash so for now there is no trace of his family.It is because of the perceived impossibility of locating a relative of the Shaline Adam's family (since all his family are dead) that the bank is making plans to ceed the said amount to the Defence Ministry for the procurement of weapons of war. In order to avert this ugly situation, few of my colleagues and I have decided to contact you and seek your   permission to have you stand as a relative to Late Shaline Adam so that the total amount of US$3.5 Million Dollars will be processed and released in your favour into your personal account.All documents and proofs to enable you get this fund will be   carefully worked out. We have secured from the probate, an   order of Madamus, to locate any of the deceased beneficiary.   Be rest assured that this transaction is risk-free. Also, your share for offering to assist us and provide the receiving account will be 10% of the total sum, while 90% will be for my colleagues and I, which also would be in your account for safe custody and probable future investment purpose in your country.As soon as we receive an acknowledgement of your willingness    to accept our proposal, we shall furnish you with further details as we concluded all arrangements to have the money transferred to you within 7 working days from the date of commencement.If this proposal is acceptable to you, then furnish us with your most confidential telephone and fax numbers  at which   time an application for the fund release will be forwarded in your favour.Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation.Regards,Ajibola JamesAlternative mail:jrade2000@caramail.com\",\n",

R.O.C.I have urgent and very confidential business\\rproposition for you.\\r\\rOn June 6, 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese\\rSolid Minerals Corporation, Mr. Smith Lawrence made a numbered time\\r(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$30,000,000.00\\r(Thirty Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine\\rnotification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,\\rwe sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract\\remployers, the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr. Smith\\rLawrence died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I\\rfound out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace\\rhis next of kin was fruitless.\\r\\rI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Smith\\rLawrence did not declare any kin or relations in all his official\\rdocuments, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of\\rUS$30,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being\\rrolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will\\rever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Republic of China,\\rat the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the\\rownership of the Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\\r\\rConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to\\rstand in as the next of kin to Mr. Smith Lawrence so that the fruits of\\rthis old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt\\rgovernment officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide\\rimmediately your full names and address so that the attorney will\\rprepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in\\rplace as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney\\rfor drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary\\rdocuments and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the\\rtransfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide\\rwill then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the\\rbeneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for\\rus to share in the ratio of 90% for me and 10% for you.\\r\\rThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will\\rbe done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees\\rthe successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested,\\rplease reply immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your\\rresponse, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant\\rdocuments that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me\\ryour confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.\\r\\rPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this\\rtransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall\\rrequire your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting\\ryour urgent reply.\\r\\rThanks and regards,\\r\\rMr.Chan Fung.\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\",\n",

       " {'content': \"ASSISTANCE & OFFER !!!Dear Sir, This letter may come to you as a surprise but I really prayed to God to help me choose somebody that will be my true partner. My name is James Nandu Savimbi.I am the first son of Mr. Jonas Savinbi, the leader of the UNITA movement in Angola. May be you know that my father was killed recently in Angola by the Angolan Government soldiers and he has since been buried. Two weeks before he died (May be he knows he will die), he called me and showed me a box containing US$20 million and some Diamond value about US$15 million. He sent the box to a security company in Europe for safe keeping with a false name. He give me the certificate of deposit and the code number. With that I can collect the box anytime I want. Now that my father is dead and I need the money to take care of the family left behind of about two wives and six children. I am now hiding as the government of Angola is desperately looking for me to assasinate and also the former commander of my father wants to get me at all cost.Also, I have to be very careful of my movement hence my search for you to help me to get the box and keep it until I can escape and meet you and you will also help me to invest the money in your country or where it is good. I will give provide you with all the power(necessary documents) to collect the box on my behalf when you tell me in your reply that you will help me and I can trust and count on you. I don't trust anybody in Angola and with the certificate and the code which I will give you, there should/will be no problem in collecting the box. You don't have to worry,as this is 100% risk free to you as only me, my dead father and the security company in Europe knows about this box. But I want you to keep this secret as there are some enemies of my father scattered all over the whole World who are friends to the government of Angola. The name of the country where the box is in Europe and how much I will give you for help shall be revealed upon your response to my mail. 1 YOUR FULL NAME 2. YOUR CONTACT (HOME)ADDRESS 3. YOUR TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER 4. YOUR DATE OF BIRTH & YOUR OCCUPATION I await your quick answer and sorry for poor english if there is any. Thank you. James Nandu Savimbi. \",\n",

However, my family is not too comfortable with our present government as my late father was a very close aide of Charles Taylor, and on this backdrop the new government might decided to recall the frozen money back to the government purse, with exception of the US$8.5M(Eight million, five hundred United State Dollars)that was deposited in a Finance/security firm undiscovered uptil date. But due to the sanction place on my family by the International community i cannot reach this money myself or withdraw it back to Liberia for use.We have jointly decided within the family to relocate this funds outside Liberia for investment purpose. This is the only way and means we can utilize this money, consequently, we beg for your assistance in investing this money on real-estate and any other viable venture you might suggest.

Before his death he had taken to Johannesburg - SouthAfrica to deposit the sum of US$ 18.5 Million (EighteenMillion Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) withSecurity and Finance Company as if he foresaw the loomingdanger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a Box as Valuables to avoid much demurrage from the SecurityCompany. This money was embarked from the purchase of NewMachinery and Chemical for Farms and the establishment ofnew farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabeintroduced a new land act that wholly affected the RichWhite Farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the\"Modus Operandi\" adopted by the government.  This resultedto rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans andsome political thugs. Precisely, More than thirty-one (31)people have so far been killed. Heads of governments fromthe west, especially Britain and United States of Americahave voiced their condemnation of Mugabe\\'s plan.Subsequently, South African Development Community (S.A.D.C)has continuously supported Mugabe\\'s new land act, it isagainst this background that I and my family who arecurrently residing in South Africa have decided  totransfer my Father\\'s money into a Foreign Account. As the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with theresponsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account wherethis money could be transferred without the knowledge of mygovernment who are tactically freezing our family wealthand South Africa\\'s government seems to be playing alongwith them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing thismoney in South Africa for fear of encountering the sameexperience in future since both countries have almost thesame political history. More so, the South African ForeignExchange policy does not allow such investment hence we areseeking for an \"ASYLUM\".As a businessperson whom I entrusted my future and that ofmy family into his hands, I must let you know that thistransaction is 100% risk free and the nature of yourbusiness does not necessarily matter. For your assistance,we are offering you 30% of the total sum, 60% for Me and MyFamily while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we mayincurs during the course of this transaction. We wish toinvest our part of the money on commercial property basedon your advice.Finally, all we demand from you is assurance that you willnot sit on this money when it finally gets to your personalor company\\'s account in your country. If this proposal isacceptable by you, please confirm your interest via theabove TEL and or E-MAIL me.Thanks and God Bless you.Best Regards.John Carlos______________________________________________________________Herbalife Independent Distributor http://www.healthiest.co.za',\n",

But before his death he ?Willed? to us some certain portion of his wealth including some amount of fund due to the love he had for my mother this fund US$24m TWENTY FOUR million united States Dollars was deposited in a box in one of the well rec!\\r ognized Security Company in South Africa, as valuables. He instructed us to solicit for the assistance of a reliable and sincere foreign partner to assist us transfer this money out of South Africa for investment purposes. Fortunately enough, I, my mother and the late President were the only people aware of this. Moreover, this box was deposited in my name and I can claim it alone with a deposited secret code of which my mother is still with the documents . Therefore, we need your assistance in transferring this huge sum of(US$24M) TWENTY FOUR Million United States Dollars inherited from my late father into your personal or company?s account and please bear in mind that the entire life and future of me and my mother depend on this fund. I will be grateful if you can assist us. For now, we live in South Africa as asylum seekers and due to this circumstances behind this fund and some family crisis we cannot invest this money in South Africa. Fo!\\r r your effort we are prepared to offer you 20% of the total su!\\r m, whi\\rle 10% will be set aside for any expenses incurred during this transaction. Please, note that this transaction is 100% risk free and the major thing I demand from you is your assurance for the safety of this money when it finally gets to you. Further information and arrangement will commence as soon as trust, confidence and good relationship are established. I shall be grateful if you maintain the confidentiality of this matter. Please confirm your interest via my e-mail address. And dont forget to drop your phone and fax number for easeir communication. Best regards KALLA KABILA.\\r\\r\\r',\n",

I am the Head of International Operations of a prime commercial bank\\rhere in Bangui, Central African Republic. I have been mandated by a\\rsenior Aide of the exiled Leader of Republic of Haiti, Jean Bertrand\\rAristide who have just been abducted and forced to exile in Bangui,\\rCAR together with his families and aides by the American and French\\rgovernment, to solicit for a reliable individual or company whom we\\rcan present as a front to effect the transfer of this funds out of Haiti.\\r\\rThe owner has secured this amount with a fictitious name at a bank\\rin Haiti. This Aide has equally assured me that with the assistance\\rof their colleagues who are still holding most key post in the financial\\rpower bases of their country, it is not a problem to have the funds\\rtransferred out of the investment bank in Haiti to any other part of\\rthe world except my county, CAR. It is not a good idea to transfer\\rthis amount to my country directly from Haiti due to the fact that my\\rcountry is one of the poorest nations in the whole world.\\r\\rSecondly, the whole world is aware that Mr.Aristide has just arrived in\\rthis country some few days ago to live in exile, it must definitely raise\\ra big dust when the money arrives here.

My name is Hassan Ahmed a merchant in Dubai, inthe U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer . It has defiledall forms of medical treatment, and right now I haveonly about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have notparticularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(noteven myself)but my business.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to peopleand only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. Butnow I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than justwanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I wouldlive my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God hascalled me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to myimmediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. Iwant God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so,I have decided to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to beone of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed moneyto some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia.Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myselfanymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts anddistribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgariaand Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I donot trust them anymore, as they seemnot to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my moneywhich no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of eighteen million dollars$21,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/SecurityCompany abroad.I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it tocharity organizations. I have set aside 10% for you and for your time.Please you can contact via my personally email address below:hassanahmed@moldova.ccGod be with you.Hassan Ahmed. \",\n",

       " {'content': \"DearMy name is John paul, a member of Independent Committee of \\rEminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibility \\rof finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss \\rindigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II. \\r\\rIt may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's \\rAssociation published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by \\rnon-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World \\rWar II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.\\r\\rThe continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons \\r(ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant \\raccounts - 54,000 in December, 1999.\\r\\rThe published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including \\rinterest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit \\rboxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. \\rNumbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that \\rwere interest bearing when established.\\r\\rThe Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims \\ron accounts due non-Swiss citizens.

ICEP is charged with the responsibility \\rof finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss \\rindigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II. \\r\\rIt may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's \\rAssociation published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by \\rnon-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World \\rWar II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.\\r\\rThe continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons \\r(ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant \\raccounts - 54,000 in December, 1999.\\r\\rThe published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including \\rinterest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit \\rboxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. \\rNumbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that \\rwere interest bearing when established.\\r\\rThe Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims \\ron accounts due non-Swiss citizens.

I am MR solomon mudani, the Auditor General of a bank in Africa, during the course of our auditing, I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this account again, after going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of the account died without a [heir] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. Arthur Coleman , a foreigner, and an Industrialist, who died since 1993 and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that Arthur Coleman until his death was the manager of Coleman Coy.(pty).

I want to first transfer $52,000.000 [fifty two million United States Dollars from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, without valid international foreign passport, but can only be approved to a foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the money is in US DOLLARS and the former owner of the a/c Mr. Arthur Coleman is a foreigner too, [and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.

Send also your private telephone and fax numbers including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any account of your choice where the fund will be safe before we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and investments. I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you, upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with instructions of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business. I need your strong assurance that you will never,never let me down. With my influence and the position of the bank official, we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing.

First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me.I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.This amount (US$18.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the US$18.5 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction.I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my secured email address richard_mboweni@rediffmail.com whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me contact other another Foreign partner with recommendation to carry out this deal. I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter; because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. I am available to entertain any questions concerning the clarity of this transaction.Yours faithfully,Dr. Richard Mboweni                                                                      ',\n",

Before his death we were both born again\\rChristians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry\\ror get a child outside my matrimonial home which the\\rBible is against.When my late husband was alive he\\rdeposited the sum of$27.6Million (twenty-seven Million\\rsix hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one\\rfinance/security company in Europe.\\r\\rPresently, this money is still with the Security\\rCompany. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not\\rlast for the next three months due to cancer problem.\\rThough what disturbs me most is my stroke.\\r\\r Having known my condition I decided to donate this\\rfund to church or better still a christian individual\\rthat will utilize this money the way I am going to\\rinstruct here in. I want a church or individual that\\rwill use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows\\rpropagating the word of God and to ensure that the\\rhouse of God is maintained. The Bible made us to\\runderstand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.\\r\\rI took this decision because I don?t have any child\\rthat will inherit this money and my husband relatives\\rare not Christians and I don?t want my husband?s hard\\rearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don?t\\rwant a situation where this money will be used in an\\rungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold\\rdecision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where\\rI am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom\\rof the Lord.\\r\\rExodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case\\rand I shall hold my peace. I don?t need any telephone\\rcommunication in this regard because of my health,and\\rbecause of the presence of my husband?s relatives\\raround me always. I don?t want them to know about this\\rdevelopment. With God all things are possible. As soon\\ras I receive your reply I shall give you the contact\\rof the Finance/Security Company Europe. I will also\\rissue you a letter of authority that will empower you\\ras the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you\\rand the church to always pray for me because the lord\\ris my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of\\ra worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the\\rLord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always\\rbe prayerful all through your\\rlife.\\r\\rAny delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing\\rfor a church or christian individual for this same\\rpurpose. Please assure me that you will act\\raccordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from\\ryou.\\r\\rplease reply me through this email;\\r<mrsjfpeters@postmaster.co.uk>\\r\\rRemain blessed in the name of the Lord.\\rYours in Christ,\\rMrs Juliana faith peters.\\r\\r\\r\\r__________________________________________________\\rBroadband from an unbeatable £15.99!\\r\\rhttp://www.tiscali.co.uk/products/broadband/home.html?code=SM-NL-11AM\\r\\r\\r\\r',\n",

       " {'content': 'PROFITABLE BUSINESS VENTURE FOR YOU AND IINTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANK LTD. (ICB).\\rCIRCLE ACCRA BRANCH, ACCRA-GHANA.\\r\\rBeloved One,\\r\\rSir,\\r\\rLet me start by introducing myself. I am Mrs. Monica Kofi credit\\r\\rofficer of the International Commercial Bank Ltd. (ICB) I have a\\r\\rconcealed business suggestion for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our\\r\\rclient General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also\\r\\rbusiness man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with\\r\\ra value of (US$8,000,000.00) Eight Millions United State Dollars only\\r\\rin my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during\\r\\rthe war early this year. Again after the war another notification was\\r\\rsent and still no response came from him.\\r\\rWe later find out that the General and his family had been killed\\r\\rduring the war in bomb blast that hit their home. After further\\r\\rinvestigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not\\r\\rdeclare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work\\r\\rof his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at\\r\\rmy office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.\\r\\rSo, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still\\r\\rlying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What\\r\\rbothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at\\r\\rthe expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the\\r\\rGhana Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this\\r\\rbackdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner\\r\\rto stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be\\r\\rable to receive his funds.\\r\\rWHAT IS TO BE DONE:\\r\\rI want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we\\r\\rshall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will\\r\\rprepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin\\r\\rto Gen. Ibrahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is\\r\\rfor you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the\\r\\rattorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of\\r\\rkin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and\\r\\rsecure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for\\r\\rthe move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.\\r\\rThere is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a\\r\\rLegalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary\\r\\rdocuments. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters\\r\\rconcerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your\\r\\rnominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 50% for me, 40%\\r\\rfor you and 10% for the Charity/Motherless babies Home. Should you be\\r\\rinterested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy\\r\\rcommunication and I will provide you with more details of this\\r\\roperation.\\r\\rYour earliest response to this letter will be appreciated. You can as\\r\\rwell call me on this number for more clarifications: + 233-24-4026959\\r\\rfor more information. And easy communication.\\r\\rKind Regards,\\r\\rMrs. Monica Kofi.\\r\\r\\r',\n",

And accept my indecent introduction, it was bore out of my despiration to get off my inadequcy to takle my immediate problems.\\r .\\r As a matter of introduction, I am the only surviving daughter of late Chief Ibrahim Sessey Cola, the paramount chief of Munsh District of Sierra Leone who was killed on  8th January  1999, by the trigger happy rebels. Most unfortunately\\rfor me I came  from a polygamous family, and a student but out of school because of this problem.\\rDuring my father's lifetime he was actively engaged in ILLEGAL MINING AND SALES OF\\rDIAMOND, from where he made his enormous wealth.\\rPrior to my father's death, he left a WILL with his lawyer, which was made available to us upon\\robservation and conclusion of his burial. And as the only daughter most of his\\rproperties were willed to me, most importantly is the sum of US$35M (thirty five million United States\\rdollars)which he deposited in a private security company in Europe which is also among my inheritance from my\\rdeceased father.\\r\\rI obviously know that it might be very difficult for you to believe my story but it is what is really happing to me now for\\rupon introduction of this WILL all my father's relatives have not been at peace with me, they were\\rnot happy how my father assigned all the enormous wealth to me. As a poor girl, they have systematically and forcefully\\rcollected from me all documents of the properties 'willed' to me. Not including a huge amount of money at ARE Bank of\\rsierra Leone which they could not withdrawn due to a court order restraining either party from making withdrawals pending the determination of a Litigation filled by my father's relations\\rchallenging the WILL. Now since I am too hard for them{ the relatives) to subdue, they were making\\rattempts to kill me so that nobody can stop them from carrying out their act, as they have succeeded in\\rkilling my mother last year. Infact the fear and warning of killing me has well griped me so much that I could\\rnot bear it anymore, hence I ran away from our family house to live with a school mate of mine whose father\\ris a military man,with advise of my father*s lawyer to safeguard my life.\\r\\rConsidering my age and inexperienced in business and investment procedures, please I want you to help me\\rin  retreving this fund which I will use to  invest  in a profitable venture in a country where there is\\rEconomic and political stability.  And if I may ask.......\\r\\r 1 .Is your country good for such investment???\\r\\rBecause I do not want to make mistake.\\r\\r2 Can you help me???? without trying to double cross me\\r\\rIf you assent to help me in this regard, we shall then discuss what I will give you in return for your assistance. And before I disclose anything, we  will firstly have to sign a Memorandum of Understanding\\r upon which  you shall proceed to the official premises of the Security Company to take delivery of\\rthe funds which I will use for  forfurther investment with your help or with the help of another person pending what comes out between us.\\rPlease put into consideration my incapabilities in some respects, therefore I would prefer all correspondence\\rto be through Email which is more secret and confidential, as I can not use my school mate father's telephone\\rto avoid jeopardizing my staythere.

I know this letter might cometo you as a surprise but I honestly do not intend to surprise you. I writethis letterin respect of my intention to invest the sum of US$28M(TwentyEight Million United State Dollars) with you. I inherited this moneyfrom my mother. This money was got through the smuggling and sale ofDiamond and Timber when my father was the head of state. My mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position toengage in the business of Diamond and Timber since she knows that hersurvival will depend on how much she can get out of the privilegesituation.When my father was assassinated on 16TH Jan. 01 by one of hisbodyguards Lt.Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some top armyofficers that wanted to topple him I escaped to South Africa because ofthe fear that I might be arrested by my half brother Lt. General JosephKabila the present head of state. Actually his mother and my mother arenot in the best of relationship because of who among them will be thefirst lady tussle and this ultimately affected us theirchildren.Considering the relationship between South Africa and theDemocratic Republic of Congo new government, my mother advised me to leaveFor South Africa for security reason, while the funds were deposited witha security Company in Madrid Spain. On getting to South Africa where Ihave been living since then as a political refugee I am seeking for areliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this money out for safebanking and profitable investment. Honestly I contacted you because Idon't want to invest this money in South Africa due to my status here as apolitical Refugee. And moreover I wouldn't want to take risk because thismoney is all that I and my Mother is depending on because My half brotherhas seized all my father's assets and money and left I and my mother emptyhanded without knowing about this funds deposited at the Security Companyin Madrid Spain so that is why I decided that investing this money abroadshould be the best investment for me. I will be honored if I can be giventhe privilege of investing this money with your help.In view of thisplight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to thisdistress call to save my mother and I from a hopeless future. And if you agree, I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candideffort in this regard with 20% of the total money and annual 5% of theafter tax returns on investment for the first three years. Thereafter, theterm shall be varied. 5% for expenses, which may arise during thetransaction, fax and phone bills inclusive.$28million US Dollars. when themoney ($28million) is moved into your discrete account, you will beallowed to draw 20% your favor, while the remaining 70% will be investedmeaningfully for our future if possible in your area of business anddeterrents sectors of the Economy in your country which are dividendsyielding. Whatever your decision is please reach me immediately through myprivate phone or Email, and keep this letter tight secret for the interestof my family.

I am Mr.David Bongani the son of Dr. Simon Bongani,who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through the South Africa Informations Exchange (S.A.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you, my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority.   Before his death he had taken to Johannesburg -South Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 35.5 Million (Thirty-five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was depositedin a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the \"modus operandi\" adopted by the government.This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs.  precisely, More than thirty-one (31) people have so far been killed.Heads of governments from the west, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe\\'s plan. Subsequently, South African Development Community(S.A.D.C) has continously supported Mugabe\\'s new land act, it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father\\'s money into a foreign account.   As the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa\\'s government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history.More so, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an \"ASYLUM\".   As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.For your assistance,we are offering you 30% of the total sum,60% for me and my family while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we may incure during the course of this transaction.We wish to invest ourpart of the money on commercial property based on your advice. Finally,all we demand from you is assurance that you will not sit on this money when it finally gets to your personal or company\\'s account in your country.  If this proposal is acceptable by you, please confirm your interest via the above TELEPHONE number +27-83-424-7661or E-MAIL to the above address. Best Regards. David Bongani(For the Family). ',\n",

He is one of the richest contractors based in Nigeria before he died on 10th Jan 2000 together with his only daughter Kimberly in a motor accident. the reason I am telling you these is because since Mr. Murphy died, a lot of letters and faxes has been coming to me the personal assistant to inform the next of kin to the late Mr. Murphy for the collection of $15 million united states dollars (fifteen million united states dollars) which is his balance for the road construction contract he executed for the Nigerian government. But late Mr. Murphy has no next of kin; he died together with his only child Kimberly who is the next of kin. I lived with him for 20 good years and he lost his parents when he was a small boy. Mr. Murphy generation is finished. But nobody knows his history apart from me the personal assistant he told me everything about his life before he died. So this is what I want the both of us to do immediately, I will present you as the next of kin I have all documents and files of the late Mr. Murphy which will cover you up fully as the next of kin. The Contract Award Committee is waiting for me to inform the next of kin of late Mr. Murphy for him or her to contact the payment committee for them to release the $15 million United States dollars to the next of kin. Anybody I present as the next of kin the money will be given to the person joyfully with my approval. It is only I the personal assistant that can produce the next of kin. This is a quick and sweet business if only you will cooperate with me there is nothing to fear in this business since I am involved. The last letter the contract Award committee wrote to me yesterday was that if I cannot inform the next of kin, to contact them for the collection of the $15 million, that the funds will be sent into their government account and it will be used to purchase arms for their soldiers. I am just coming back from their office before writing you this letter; I told them that the next of kin will contact them very soon for the collection of fund. So I want the both of us to do this business together and collect the $15 million dollars when the fund is collected we must remove 10% of the total amount and give to charity homes then yourself and myself will now share the remaining equally 45% for you 45% for me. Please do not tell anybody what I just wrote to you for security reasons and for the safety of the business. Please if you will do this business with me send me your telephone number so that I can reach you. I wait to hear from you as soon as possible. Rahim Sule',\n",

I am presently undergoing trial in Abuja though have just been recently granted bail under the condition that my family refunds to the Federal Government some money held in accounts in Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Jersey and in Switzerland. In return, all criminal proceedings against members of my family be dropped ( a deal which was brokered by the international community).To save the family from total bankruptcy I have managed to ship through a courier company, the sum of US$12, 000,000.00, kept by my late father. This money has become the only inherited property of our family since  the government and its loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us by freezing all the family account and has auctioned most of our properties.The money has since been deposited with a private finance andsecurity firm in Europe. I am willing to offer a percentage agreeable to you.

SUSAN SHABANGU, a mother of three children and the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy since 1st April 1996 to date under the auspices of the President of South Africa MR THABO MBEKI.\\rYou can view my profile at my Website www.gov.za then click on deputy\\rministers, and then click on my name (shabangu susan.\\r\\rTHE PROPOSAL, after the swearing in ceremony making me the Deputy\\rMinister of Minerals and Energy, my husband Mr. Ndelebe Shabangu died while he was on an official trip to Trinidad and Tobago in 1996.\\rAfter his death, I discovered that he had some funds in a dollar\\raccount which amounted to the sum of US$30.5M with a security and finance institution in South Africa of which I will divulge information to you when I get your full consent and support to go for a change of beneficiary and subsequent transfer of the funds into you comfortable and conducive account of your choice.This fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced contract which he executed with the Government of South Africa.Though I assisted him in getting this  contract but I never knew that it was over-invoiced by him. I am afraid that the government of South Africa might start to investigate on contracts awarded from 1990 to date.\\rIf they discover this money in his bank account, they will confiscate\\rit and seize his assets here in South Africa and this will definitely affect my political career in government.

I am the son of Late General Alexandre Aka Williams the former Director of military inteligence and special acting General Manager of the Sieria Leone Diamond mining coperation (S.L.D.M.C.) I am writing to seek your good assistance to transfer and invest this sum of $9.000,000.dollars in your country belongs to my late father which he inherited during his life time in my country. This money is revenues from solid minirals and Dimonds sale which were under my fathers possession before the civil war broke out. Following the brake out of the war, almost all Government offices,coperations and parastatals were attacked and vandalized.The (S.L.D.M.C) was loothed and burnt down to ashes, and diamonds worth millions of dollars was stolen by the rebel military forces who attacked my fathers office. Many top Government officials and senior Army officers were assasinated and my father was a key target because of his very sensitive military possition and appointment in the (S.L.D.M.C.) regreatable to me, my father was captured and murdered along with my senior brother in cool blood during a mid-night attack and the rebel when our residence in freetown was armbushed by Fordey Sanko the notorious rebel leader. Our mother sustainded very several bullet injuries which resulted to her untimely and painful death in a private hospital here in Ivory Coast. Now we are alone in a totally strange country without parents, relatives or any body to care for us at our tender ages. before our mother died, she told me that my father deposited a hung amount which he made from diamond sales and contracts at this bank here in Ivory Coast and that we should pray and find a trustworthy foreign business partner who would help us to transfer and invest this money in profitable business venture overseas. Mother also advice me to act quickly so that we can leave Ivory Coast with our cousin brother-Arthur who is here in the camp withe us,and then settle down abroad for the rest of our life.She also gave me all the deposit documents to claim the money and then told me that my father used my name as the only son to deposit the money in the bank,and also advice me that this is the reason why we came to Ivory Coast. My mother died after her advice to me May her spirit rest In perfect peace. Furthermore, I have gone to the bank to make inquires about this deposit and I spoke with the director of International remittance who assured me that verything is intact and promised to help me transfer this money to my foreign partners bank account as soon as I provide the bank account informations. However, the director is very concerned because of our sitaution here, I am 17 years and as such promised to help me and he would like to speak with my partner to ensure that this money is invested wisely in only profitable business because of his personal interest and sympathy for my family. Please note that I will offer you 15% of the total money as compensation for your noble assistance in accordiance with my mothers advise.I am interested in any profitable commercial venture which you consider very good in your country and you would also get a school for me and my little sister and my cousin so that we can finish our education. I am hoping to hear from you so that i will give you more details information. Upon the confirmation of this money into your account we will fly immediately to your country to meet with you for onward investment according to my mother's advice.Thanks. Yours sincerelyWilliams.Accédez au courrier électronique de La Poste : www.laposte.net ; 3615 LAPOSTENET (0,34�/mn) ; tél : 08 92 68 13 50 (0,34�/mn)\",\n",

I am William Mabaye the first and only surviving son of late Tutu Mabaye one of the foremost and rich black farmers in Zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg-South Africa, to deposit the sum of US$25 million (Tweenty Five Million United States Dollars) in one of the private security companies, as family valuables, when he realized the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in Swaziland.This land dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land reform, which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers (my father included). This resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers (mainly whites) and the unlawful possession of their properties by Mugabe?s war veterans, under the disguise of fighting for the interest of the country. It is against this background that I fled the country with my family, to the Netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum.I have decided to seek foreign assistance, as the Netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind, hence this letter to you. All I need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities. My family?s survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets.There are two options, firstly, you can choose to accept 25% of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment of the money in your country. We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when you reply providing me with your telephone & fax numbers. I await your reply through the  above email ,while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free transaction.I shall furnish you with more details on request.Yours trulyWilliam Mabaye',\n",

       " {'content': \"Mr.Larry Edwards.Mr.Larry Edwards.Plot,1287 Port Shepstone Ridder Hargerd Close, South Africa. Email:S_ed@consultant.com.Dear President/Ceo.We want to transfer to overseas the sum of One hundred and Forty Two Million United States Dollars (U.S.$142,000,000.00) from South Africa.I want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank account immediately to receive this money,though an empty bank account could serve this purpose as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in time to come.I am Mr.Larry Edwards,the external auditor of a Bank.During the course of our auditing,I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this account again.After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that the owner of the account died without a �Heir apparent to the throne� hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.The owner of this account who is Mr.Gregory A.Williams,a foreigner and an industrialist died, since 1990,until now no other person(s) knows about this account or could give any documentary evidence concerning this account. As such this account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that Mr.Gregory A.Williams until his death was the manager Diamond Safari Company,in South Africa.However, if you are interested in this business we will start the first money transfer with Forty Two Million U.S.Dollars(U.S.$42,000,000.00) upon successful transaction without any disappointment from you. We shall also re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account.While the total amount involved is One hundred and Forty Two Million United States Dollars (U.S.$142,000,000.00)only.I would want us to make a first transfer of [Forty Two Million United States Dollar.(U.S.$42,000,000.00)from this money into a safe Foreigners account abroad before the rest. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local account, without valid international foreign �Agreement�, but could only be approved to any foreigner with valid international credentials: passport or drivers license and foreign account because this sum is in U.S. dollars and the former owner of the account Mr.Gregory A.Williams is a foreigner too,thus the money could only be approved into a foreign account.However, knowing all this, we will reach a binding agreement in this regards.As a matter of urgency, I will inform you the next step to take, while you Send your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any account of your choice where the fund will be safe Before we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and investments,I need your full co-operation to make this business a success,because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you,upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business. I need your strong assurance that you will never let me down.With my influence and the position in the bank we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing.And to build confidence that you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account. I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that you are ready to act as directed. To prove the authenticity of the business I will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries,foreign exchange departments, embassy and Board of Internal Revenue Services.At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total amount,60% will be for me,while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during this process.I look forward to your earliest reply throughmy email address:S_ed@consultant.com.Yours,Mr.Larry Edwards.Alternative Email:S_ed@consultant.com.\",\n",

       " {'content': \"THANK YOUGood Day,\\rI know you will find this surprising,please pardon my surprise. With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings,and I hope this mail meets you in good time.I have mused over your profile for sometime and decided to contact you in this regard. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past,I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I also sincerely seek your confidence, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.\\rFirst and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Mr.Robert Savimbi,I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email.\\rMy Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death,Mr. Antonio Dembo and general Paulo Lukamba who were his second in commands, assumed office as leaders of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo and general lukamba,\\rthere was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose them and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension\\rand confusion in UNITA became uncontrollable when Mr.Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now\\rdesire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek political asylum.\\rI am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (Eighteen Million Dollars Only), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank\\raccount, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam,Netherlands. in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited\\rfor sometime now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to the netherlands to sought for political asylum here is because of the safe deposit.\\rPresident Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here.\\rI plan to use this money to safeguard my families future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.\\rYour role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name from the Security and finance company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here.\\rFor your reliable assistance, I will reward you with Fifteen Percent of the Money of the money.\\rI have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.\\rI thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal.\\rPlease contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.\\rTo know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate Angola, click on the link below and read.\\r\\rhttp://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.html\\rhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_1839000/1839252.stm\\r\\rTHANKS,GOD BLESS.\\rSincerely,\\rSavimbi.\\r\\rPlease let me know you got my email by replying to my personal email address :\\rsavimbi765@zensearch.com\\r\\r\",\n",

I am Mr.Jonathan Bongani the son of Dr. Simon Bongani,who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through the South Africa Informations Exchange (S.A.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you, my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority.   Before his death he had taken to Johannesburg -South Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 35.5 Million (Thirty-five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was depositedin a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the \"modus operandi\" adopted by the government.This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs.  precisely, More than thirty-one (31) people have so far been killed.Heads of governments from the west, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe\\'s plan. Subsequently, South African Development Community(S.A.D.C) has continously supported Mugabe\\'s new land act, it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father\\'s money into a foreign account.   As the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa\\'s government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history.More so, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an \"ASYLUM\".   As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.For your assistance,we are offering you 30% of the total sum,60% for me and my family while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we may incure during the course of this transaction.We wish to invest ourpart of the money on commercial property based on your advice. Finally,all we demand from you is assurance that you will not sit on this money when it finally gets to your personal or company\\'s account in your country.  If this proposal is acceptable by you, please confirm your interest via the above TELEPHONE number +27-83-424-7661or E-MAIL to the above address. Best Regards. Jonathan Bongani(For the Family).',\n",

I am Mr.Jonathan Bongani the son of Dr. Simon Bongani,who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through the South Africa Informations Exchange (S.A.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you, my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority.   Before his death he had taken to Johannesburg -South Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 35.5 Million (Thirty-five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was depositedin a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the \"modus operandi\" adopted by the government.This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs.  precisely, More than thirty-one (31) people have so far been killed.Heads of governments from the west, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe\\'s plan. Subsequently, South African Development Community(S.A.D.C) has continously supported Mugabe\\'s new land act, it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father\\'s money into a foreign account.   As the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa\\'s government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history.More so, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an \"ASYLUM\".   As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.For your assistance,we are offering you 30% of the total sum,60% for me and my family while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we may incure during the course of this transaction.We wish to invest ourpart of the money on commercial property based on your advice.

But this mail comes from a devastated, sorrowful and emotional laden soul that needs compassion from a kind and good spirited person to wipe away my tears and appropriate my dream and humanitarian gesture.As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone dies someday.My name is Naybet Trabelsi a merchant in Dubai,in the U.A.E.I worked with Zambian Ministry of Mining and Resources for eight years as a contractor,I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment,I am very worried as the doctors have informed me that its terminal.I don't know how much time I have left on earth, hence this mail to you.I have not particularly lived my life  well, as I never really cared for anyone but mybusiness. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul hence, I decided to give alms to charityorganizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E,Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be content with what I have left for them.The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of $18,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations.I have set aside 20% for you and for your time.God be with you.Reply to:naybet@web-mail.com.arNaybet Trabelsi>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>FREE Email?

       " {'content': 'BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP Attn: President/CEO/SIR/MADAMREQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP -STRICTLY CONFIDENTIALFirstly, I must solicit your confidentiality. This is by virtue of it\\'snature as being utterly \"confidential\" and \"TOP SECRET\". Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried,but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. A bold step taken shall not be regretted I assure you.I am Mr iyang and I head a seven man tender board in charge of contract awards and payment approvals. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction,which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence. My colleagues and I are top official of Federal Government Contract Review and Award Panel. Our duties include evaluation,vetting, and approval for payment of contract jobs done for the Federal Ministry of Aviation(FMA) etc. We are therefore soliciting for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds. Our country looses a lot of money everyday that is why the international community is very careful and warning their citizens to be careful but I tell you \"a trial will convince you\".The source of the fund is as follow: During the last military regime here in Nigeria, this committee awarded a contract of US$400 Million to a group of five construction firms on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Aviation (FMA)for the supply and installation of landing and navigationalequipment in Lagos and Port Harcourt International Airports. During this process my colleagues and I decided among us to deliberately over inflate the total contract sum of US$420.5 Million with the aim of sharing the remaining sum of US$20.5 million.The government has since approved the sum of US$420.5Million for us as the contract sum, but since the contract is only worth US$400M the remaining US$20.5 Million is what we intend to transfer to a reliable and safe offshore account,we are prohibited to operate foreign accountin our names since we are still in Government. Thus, making it impossible for us to acquire the money in our name right now, I havetherefore been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues to look for an oversea partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of US$20.5Million.Mycolleagues and I have decided that if you/your Company can as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of thetotal amount (US$20.5Million) while 75% will be for us (officials) and the remaining 5% will be used in offsetting all debts/expenses incurred during thistransaction We have decided that this transaction can only proceed under the following condition(a) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and that you treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality(b) That upon Receipt of the funds you will release the funds as instructed by us after you\\'ve removed your share of 20%. Please acknowledge the receiptof this letter using the above e-mail address. I will bring you into the complete of this transaction when I\\'ve heard from you.Your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we are already behind schedule for the financial quarter. Please do be informed that his business transaction is 100% legal and completely free from drug or money laundering.Only trust can make the reality of this transaction.Best regards,Mr iyang',\n",

       " {'content': 'PLEASE YOUR ASSISTANCE IN URGENTLT NEEDEDDear Sir,It is with hope that I write to seek your help in the context below.I am Hajia Mariam Abacha, wife of Nigeria�s former head of state; Late General Sani Abacha, whose sudden death occurred on the 8th of June 1998. Since my husband died, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration.The security agents in the country have subjected me to physical and psychological torture. My son (Mohammed Abacha) is still under detention arraigned before the federal high court of Nigeria for an offence he did not commit. As a widow that is so traumatized, I am hopeless with my present faith. You must have heard over the media reports on the recovery of various sums of money deposited by my late husband with various security firms. Some companies willingly gave up their secret and disclosed our money confidently lodged there, or many, outright blackmail. Infact the total sum discovered by the government so far is in the tune of $700 Million USD and they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I came in contact with your name and address in a website and would want to have good confidence in you as I view you to be a responsible personality. I have no doubt about your capacity and goodwill to assist me in receiving into your custody( for safety) the sum of $50 Million USD willed and deposited safely in my favour by my late husband. This money is currently kept in Safe Deposit Box (SDB) at a security firm within Europe. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband�s property is under the authority of the family�s Lawyer (Attorney)Barrister MIKE AHAMBA(SAN).The investigative teams set up by government have submitted their report after freezing almost all our account. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the $50m USD be urgently moved to an overseas account of any trust worthy but ANNONYMOUS foreign family friend without delay, for security reasons. All our traveling papers have been seized by the government thereby preventing us from traveling and all the local and international outfit of our business empire seized. This sum of money is our only hope to stay alive. I have therefore agreed to compensate your goodself with 10% of the total deposit when you finally the deposit box from the security firm and lodged in your account. They have equally guaranteed 100% risk-free and smooth transfer. If you are interested in assisting me,you can write me through my e-mail, please reply direct to this email address; dr_mrsabacha@sify.com  for obvious security reasons, it is imperative that you keep all our communication very secret. Donot mention my family\"s name or disclose the transaction to anybody.If you are not interested in assisting me, still get in touch so that I can make alternative arrangement as time is of the essence.Please do not expose me.Best Regards,Hajia mariam AbachaEMAIL: dr_mrsabacha@sify.com',\n",

For the fact that PRESIDENT BENJAMIN MKAPA, never showed any concern since the death of my father and after I discovered that my life was no longer safe I decided to leave to Ghana ,West Africa where I am residing now with my own family.\\rMeanwhile here in Ghana West Africa I don’t think of going back and for this I and my family have decided to transfer my father’s money into a foreign account in a Islamic counrty. As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who have tactically frozen our family wealth as I may not trust the system of African government. Furthermore, the new Ghana government does not allow such investment hence I am seeking for asylum. As a business person whom I must entrust my future and that of my family into his hands I must let you know that this transaction is 100% RISK FREE and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.\\rTherefore, if you accept to assist me and my family, we are willing to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, 75% for me and my family, while 5% will be mapped out for any expenses that may be incurred in the process of this transaction. We wish to invest our money on commercial property based on your advice and I will also wish to receive your genuine assurance that you would not sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your personal or company’s account. If this transaction is acceptable by you.\\rBEST REGARDS\\rDR. RANI ALI JUMA.\\r',\n",

       " {'content': \"reply plsMy Dear,It is with heartfelt hope that I write to seek your co-operation and assistance in the context stated below:May I first introduce my self: I am DR.(MRS.) MARIAM ABACHA,the wife of Late General Sani Abacha (former Military head of state and President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) who died suddenly on 8th June1998. I got your contact through the help of my sister-inlaw that works with the Canadian Chambers of Commerce and Tourrism,though,I did not disclose to her my humble intention for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children. Having noted the confidence reposed on your person by the sponsor of the recommendation, I became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of US$20 Million secretly willed in my favour by the late general (my husband).   This money was kept in a Security Company in Spain and I have all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a Security Vault for safe keeping.This money has been defaced for Security reasons and also to avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons.We have been deliberating on how to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for non-speculative investments in your country.However,the current civilian administration of retired General Olusegun Obasanjo(The President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) is seeking vengeance on the Abacha family because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office. In pursuit of this vendetta,the present Government have resolved to freeze all known assets of General Sani Abacha including properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband in Switzerland,UK and Australia. In fact, the attack on ou! r family (The Abacha's) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling passport,family accounts and even trying some members of our family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband. My first son Mohammed Abacha who was arrested and incacerated for the past 3years was just reliese from prison on the agreement to refund $1.5 Billion to the Federal Government of Nigeria allegedly stollen by my late Husband.We are not ready to comply to this as most of the family assets and bank accounts abroad have been Freezen by the Obasanjo regime.  In view of this grevious threat to our Economic and personal survival,our family trustee have secretly protected the will,The Security Company has called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the demurrage it is incurring and I told them we would come and claim it very soon but they seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas account, hence the reason why I have chosen you and hope that you will come to my full assistance and unlimited co-operation.In the meantime,there is a travelling embargo on us(the whole family members) and our local accounts are seized. We are currently living on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the sins of my late husband. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my children from a hopeless future. And if you agree to help, we will compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in!  this regard with 25% of the total amount of $20 Million US Dollars.In that case, when the money ($20 Million) is moved into your discrete account, you will be allowed to withdraw 25% in your favour,while 10% has been set aside for any expenses you might incure (There are demurrage to pay before the fund is sign and claimed by you.)during the process of securing this fund.The remaining 65% will be invested meaningfully for my children's future.   My cousin (KADIRI MOHAMMED) has perfected arrangements with the Trust Company concerned and has been assured 100% risk free and safe operation.What I demand from you now is to arrange to visit the Finance Company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide owner.And in due course, all contacts must be made throughDR.KADIRI MOHAMMED through his Telephone: 00 221 5124859.E-mail address: kadiri_hammed@elvis.comI look forward to your quick response while thankingyou for your co-operation. In view of all abovedetails, I request you to keep this letter andco-operation highly confidential.Best wishes,DR.(MRS). MARIAM ABACHA.ABACHAS LODGE,KANO.\",\n",

       " {'content': \"CHARITY SUPPORTDear Friend.As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry forme, because, I believe everyone will die someday.My name is MR.HARRY HAKEEM, a merchant in Dubai, in theU.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a fewmonths to live, according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my life so well, as Inever really cared for anyone(not even myself)but mybusiness. Though I am very rich, I was nevergenerous, I was always hostile to people and onlyfocused on my business as that was the only thing Icared for. But now I regret all this as I now knowthat there is more to life than just wanting to haveor make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to cometo this world I would live my life a different wayfrom how I have lived it. Now that God has calledme, I have willed and given most of my propertyand assets to my immediate and extended familymembers as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soulso, I have decided to give alms to charityorganizations, as I want this to be one of the lastgood deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributedmoney to some charity organizations in the U.A.E,Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health hasdeteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myselfanymore. I once asked members of my family to close oneof my accounts and distribute the money which I havethere to charity organization in Bulgaria andPakistan, they refused and kept the money tothemselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, asthey seem not to be contended with what I have leftfor them.The last of my money which no one knows of is thehuge cash deposit of TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS$12,000,000,that I have with a finance/Security Companyabroad. I will want you to help me collect this depositand dispatched it to charity organizations.I have set aside 25% for you and for your time if you want to help me to collect this Funds and also invest this money.N.B-PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THELAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IN HOLLAND IMMEDIATELY, HEDOES EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE'S VERYUNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOURSUCCESS IN JESUS NAME.NAME:      BARRISTER.RICHARD GORDONTel:       0031630655043Email:     richardgordon13@netscape.netRemain blessed in the name of the Lord.Yours in Christ,Mr.Harry Hakeem.   \",\n",
